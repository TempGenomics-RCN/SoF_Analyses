4252,,No Population Genetic Structure of Skipjack Tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) in the Tropical Western and Central Pacific Assessed Using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms,"Anderson, G; Lal, M; Stockwell, B; Hampton, J; Smith, N; Nicol, S; Rico, C","Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) has historically been considered panmictic at the ocean basin scale because of the species' life history and substantial absolute population size. However, recent advances in population genomics have enabled scientists to demonstrate population structure in other species that were likewise traditionally assumed to be panmictic. Accordingly, we used DArTseq, a proprietary platform of reduced-representation genome sequencing developed by Diversity Arrays Technology (DArTech) to genotype 222 skipjack tuna from 9 sample groups collected across 6 exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and over 6 years in the tropical Western and Central Pacific Ocean. This is one of the most fine-scale population genetics assessments of skipjack tuna to date. We found several statistically significant pairwise F-ST comparisons using purportedly neutral loci, but very little indication of structure based on observed and expected heterozygosity, effective population size, a Mantel test, AMOVA, numerous genetic clustering and population assignment tests, and exploration of correlation with oceanographic features. Significant pairwise F-ST values were often shallow and resulted in uncertainty about their biological significance. Furthermore, a test of the hypothesis that the geographic and temporal distribution of the potentially adaptive genetic diversity may depict cryptic fine scale structure using two different outlier detection methods, could not reject panmixia based on estimates of fixation indices and two clustering software. Our results support the presence of a single population of skipjack tuna in the tropical Western and Central Pacific Ocean, but highly recommend the expansion of the study area, in latitude, longitude, and seasonality, before drawing any global conclusions.",giuliaa@spc.int,2020,10.3389/fmars.2020.570760,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,temporal-genetics,BR,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,popsize,diversity,adaptation,connectivity,,marine,Actinopterygii,Papua New Guinea,Papua New Guinea,"2012.01.01,2011.01.01,2009.01.01,2007.01.01","27,30,31,28",766,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,,,chronic,SNP,muscle,NA,CTAB,Illumina_HiSeq,RAD,"generation time pulled from: https://www.fishbase.de/summary/katsuwonus-pelamis.html, used DartTech for extraction and sequencing.

10689,,Ecology drives evolution in grey wolves,"Leonard, JA","Background: Grey wolves (Canis lupus) are a widespread, Holarctic species distributed across a wide variety of habitats, including deserts, dry plains, boreal forests, and the high arctic. They are generalist carnivores, feeding on a wide variety of species throughout their range. Wolves also disperse readily, with multiple records of over 1000 km. Despite this, surprising examples of differentiation between contiguous wolf populations have been described. Questions: How can population differentiation arise and be maintained in a continuously distributed, generalist species? How might this structure impact evolution and conservation? Data: Previously published genetic, morphological, and ecological data from ancient, historic, and modern populations of grey wolves from across their distribution. Results: Genetic differentiation of wolf populations is tightly associated with habitat characteristics. This requires that dispersing wolves primarily disperse within their natal habitat. As wolves increase their range to occupy new areas, these tend to be colonized by small numbers of wolves often occupying similar habitats. The new arrivals quickly adapt to the new conditions and may be able to exclude other potential immigrating wolves. This limitation in the admixture between populations implies that populations in vanishing habitats (i.e. due to climate change or land use change) are likely to disappear with the habitats, resulting in the loss of locally adapted ecotypes. This cycle of repeated isolation and extinction has led to the observed low level of genetic diversity both within populations and within the species, lower than for other widespread canids. Conclusions: Structure in wolf populations is generated through 'isolation by environment'. This implies that the genetic diversity is more partitioned than expected within the distribution range of wolves, leading to a decrease in the effective population size and evolutionary potential of wolves within a given habitat, a threat when facing environmental changes. This has resulted in a pattern of local extinctions and reduced genetic variation.",jleonard@ebd.csic.es,2014,,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,ancient-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"They are really just reviewing wolves.

8916,,Introductions over introductions: the genomic adulteration of an early genetically valuable alien species in the United Kingdom,"Barbanera, F; Forcina, G; Cappello, A; Guerrini, M; van Grouw, H; Aebischer, NJ","Invasive alien species are a major cause of biodiversity loss. Nevertheless, non-native species can also contribute to conservation objectives. In 1673, the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), a galliform native to southwest Europe, was introduced from France (A. r. rufa) into the UK for hunting purposes. Nowadays, hunters constantly supplement natural populations of A. rufa in its native range with stocks of captive-bred individuals. Such birds are usually genetically unscreened, and human-mediated hybridization with the exotic chukar (Alectoris chukar) has undermined genomic integrity of the species. Alectoris rufa in the UK has never been genetically investigated, and birds from East Anglian estates with no modern history of supplementation offer a potential genomic backup for the highly polluted native-range A. r. rufa. We genotyped modern and ancient (1824-1934) birds at the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) level to determine present and past kinship between East Anglian and native-range A. rufa. We used Short Tandem Repeats (STR) and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers to identify A. rufa x A. chukar hybrids. The kinship of East Anglian birds with A. r. rufa was confirmed. No A. chukar introgression was found in ancient East Anglian A. rufa. Among modern partridges, we found birds with A. chukar mtDNA, and both STRs and RAPDs disclosed many A. rufa 9 A. chukar hybrids. While the genetic analysis pointed to the increase of diversity and decline of disparity over time within and among A. rufa populations, respectively, the conservation value of the resource historically introduced to the UK proved to have been quashed by three decades of recent releases of A. chukar and its A. rufa hybrids.",filippo.barbanera@unipi.it,2015,10.1007/s10530-014-0739-5,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,ancient-dna,JW,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,adaptation,,,terrestrial,Aves,"England, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain","England,England,England,Spain,Spain,France,France.Italy,France,France,France,Spain,France.England,England,England,England,England,England.Spain,Italy,Italy,Italy,Portugal,Italy,England,France.Corsica,Corsica,England.France.Italy,England,France,Spain,Italy.Portugal,Portugal,Italy,Italy,Italy,Portugal,Spain,Spain,Spain,Portugal.Spain.France,Portugal,France,Corsica,Italy,Spain,France,Portugal,England","1824.01.01,1843.01.01,1851.01.01,1856.01.01,1857.01.01,1859.01.01,1872.01.01,1873.01.01,1874.01.01,1876.01.01,1890.01.01,1891.01.01,1892.01.01,1893.01.01,1896.01.01,1897.01.01,1898.01.01,1899.01.01,1903.01.01,1905.01.01,1906.01.01,1907.01.01,1908.01.01,1910.01.01,1912.01.01,1914.01.01,1915.01.01,1916.01.01,1918.01.01,1920.01.01,1921.01.01,1922.01.01,1923.01.01,1924.01.01,1925.01.01,1929.01.01,1930.01.01,1931.01.01,1932.01.01,1934.01.01,1938.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2007.01.01,2008.01.01,2010.01.01","1,1,1,1,1,1,2.1,1,1,1,1,2.1,1,2,1,1,1.1,1,2,2,1,4,1,1.3,1,1.1.1,1,1,1,1.1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,1.2.1,1,2,48,29,48,24,10,58",730,opportunistic,anthropogenic,invasive_species,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,skin,dried,QIAamp DNA micro kit,ABI 3730 DNA automated sequencer,PCR,"Randi E, Tabarroni C, Rimondi S, Lucchini V, Sfougaris A (2003) Phylogeography of the rock partridge (Alectoris graeca).

7207,,Spatiotemporal genetic structure of anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) populations in a region experiencing pronounced climate change,"Christensen, C; Jacobsen, MW; Nygaard, R; Hansen, MM","We examined spatio-temporal genetic variation at 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms in anadromous Arctic char populations from Western Greenland, a region experiencing pronounced climate change. The study was based on contemporary and historical samples, the latter represented by DNA extracted from otoliths and scales from the 1950s-1960s. We investigated whether genetic population structure was temporarily stable or unstable, the latter due to relatively small spawning and nursery areas combined with a harsh Arctic environment. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the potential for adaptive responses and local adaptation we estimated effective population size (N-e) and migration rate (m). Temporal stability of genetic population structure was suggested, based on a hierarchical analysis of genetic differentiation showing much higher differentiation among samples from different populations (F-CT = 0.091) than among temporal samples from the same populations (F-SC = 0.01). This was further supported by a neighbor-joining tree and assignment of individuals that showed high contingency between historical and contemporary samples. Estimates of N-e were high (> 500) in three out of four populations, with a lower estimate in one population potentially reflecting fishing pressure or suboptimal environmental conditions. Estimates of m were in most cases low, ae<currency> 0.01. N-e and m estimates suggest a potential for adaptive responses and local adaptation. However, long generation time may also cause adaptive responses by microevolution to be unable to track climate change, especially considering the low migration rates that reduce potential evolutionary rescue by gene flow from populations better adapted to the altered environments.",mmh@bios.au.dk,2018,10.1007/s10592-018-1047-x,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,AAS,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,popsize,adaptation,,,other,Actinopterygii,Greenland,"Eqaluit,Kapisilit.Kobbefjord River.Qarajat,Kobbefjord River,Praestefjord,Qarajat,Kobbefjord Lake,Kapisilit.Qarajat.Eqaluit,Kobbefjord River.Praestefjord,Lakseelv.Eqaluit","1952.01.01,1953.01.01,1963.01.01,1966.01.01,1969.01.01,2008.01.01,2012.01.01,2013.01.01,2014.01.01","27,36.22.30,7,2,3,22,,20.20.20,20.20,20.20",7300,opportunistic,anthropogenic,climate_change,,,chronic,nuclear_seq,bone,dried,E.Z.N.A.

1716,,Stepwise colonization of the Andes by Ruddy Ducks and the evolution of novel ?-globin variants,"Munoz-Fuentes, V; Cortazar-Chinarro, M; Lozano-Jaramillo, M; Mccracken, KG","Andean uplift played a key role in Neotropical bird diversification, yet past dispersal and genetic adaptation to high-altitude environments remain little understood. Here we use multilocus population genetics to study population history and historical demographic processes in the ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis), a stiff-tailed diving duck comprising three subspecies distributed from Canada to Tierra del Fuego and inhabiting wetlands from sea level to 4500m in the Andes. We sequenced the mitochondrial DNA, four autosomal introns and three haemoglobin genes (A, D, A) and used isolation-with-migration (IM) models to study gene flow between North America and South America, and between the tropical and southern Andes. Our analyses indicated that ruddy ducks dispersed first from North America to the tropical Andes, then from the tropical Andes to the southern Andes. While no nonsynonymous substitutions were found in either globin gene, three amino acid substitutions were observed in the A globin. Based on phylogenetic reconstruction and power analysis, the first A substitution, found in all Andean individuals, was acquired when ruddy ducks dispersed from low altitude in North America to high altitude in the tropical Andes, whereas the two additional substitutions occurred more recently, when ruddy ducks dispersed from high altitude in the tropical Andes to low altitude in the southern Andes. This stepwise colonization pattern accompanied by polarized A globin amino acid replacements suggest that ruddy ducks first acclimatized or adapted to the Andean highlands and then again to the lowlands. In addition, ruddy ducks colonized the Andean highlands via a less common route as compared to other waterbird species that colonized the Andes northwards from the southern cone of South America.",Violeta.Munoz@ebd.csic.es,2013,10.1111/mec.12151,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5553,,"Ancient DNA Reveals Genetic Stability Despite Demographic Decline: 3,000 Years of Population History in the Endemic Hawaiian Petrel","Welch, AJ; Wiley, AE; James, HF; Ostrom, PH; Stafford, TW; Fleischer, RC","In the Hawaiian Islands, human colonization, which began approximately 1,200 to 800 years ago, marks the beginning of a period in which nearly 75% of the endemic avifauna became extinct and the population size and range of many additional species declined. It remains unclear why some species persisted whereas others did not. The endemic Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis) has escaped extinction, but colonies on two islands have been extirpated and populations on remaining islands have contracted. We obtained mitochondrial DNA sequences from 100 subfossil bones, 28 museum specimens, and 289 modern samples to investigate patterns of gene flow and temporal changes in the genetic diversity of this endangered species over the last 3,000 years, as Polynesians and then Europeans colonized the Hawaiian Islands. Genetic differentiation was found to be high between both modern and ancient petrel populations. However, gene flow was substantial between the extirpated colonies on Oahu and Molokai and modern birds from the island of Lanai. No significant reductions in genetic diversity occurred over this period, despite fears in the mid-1900s that this species may have been extinct. Simulations show that even a decline to a stable effective population size of 100 individuals would result in the loss of only 5% of the expected heterozygosity. Simulations also show that high levels of genetic diversity may be retained due to the long generation time of this species. Such decoupling between population size and genetic diversity in long-lived species can have important conservation implications. It appears that a pattern of dispersal from declining colonies, in addition to long generation time, may have allowed the Hawaiian petrel to escape a severe genetic bottleneck, and the associated extinction vortex, and persist despite a large population decline after human colonization.",andreann@buffalo.edu,2012,10.1093/molbev/mss185,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ancient-dna,ACS,KC,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,popsize,diversity,,,other,Aves,United States,"Hawaii,Maui,Lanai,Molokai,Oahu.Hawaii,Maui,Lanai,Molokai,Kauai.Hawaii,Maui,Lanai,Molokai,Kauai.Hawaii,Maui,Lanai,Molokai,Kauai","NA,1907.01.01,1914.01.01,NA","195,12,26,512",5475,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,invasive_species,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,bone,dried,phenol/chloroform Fleischer et al. 2000,Sanger,Targeted_sequence_capture,"supplement for generation time.

Pangolins are the most heavily trafficked mammals across illegal wildlife trade globally, but critically endangered Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) have not been widely studied in insular Southeast Asia. We used > 12,000 single nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs) to assign pangolin seizures from illegal trade of unknown origin to possible geographic sources via genetic clustering with pangolins of known origin. Our SNPs reveal three previously unrecognized genetic lineages of Sunda pangolins, possibly from Borneo, Java and Singapore/Sumatra. The seizure assignments suggest the majority of pangolins were traded from Borneo to Java. Using mitochondrial markers did not provide the same resolution of pangolin lineages, and to explore if admixture might explain these differences, we applied sophisticated tests of introgression using > 2000 SNPs to investigate secondary gene flow between each of the three Sunda pangolin lineages. It is possible the admixture which we discovered is due to human-mediated movements of pangolins. Our findings impact a range of conservation actions, including tracing patterns of trade, repatriation of rescue animals, and conservation breeding. In order to conserve genetic diversity, we suggest that, pending further research, each pangolin lineage should as a precaution be protected and managed as an evolutionarily distinct conservation unit.",helencatherinenash@yahoo.co.uk,2018,10.1007/s10592-018-1080-9,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,,The conservation genetics of Ash Meadows pupfish populations. I. The Warm Springs pupfish Cyprinodon nevadensis pectoralis,"Martin, AP","The Warm Springs pupfish (Cyprinodon nevadensis pectoralis) inhabits several low flow (<0.15 cfs) springs in an otherwise dry Mojave Desert landscape. Increasing demands on groundwater coupled with predictions of decreased precipitation from global warming make this species a sentinel for biodiversity dependent on springs. Here we examine mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and nuclear microsatellite genotypes for individuals sampled in 1998 and 2007 as a means of inferring the historical demography of the subspecies. Estimates of genetic effective population size from comparison of allele frequencies over time underscores that all spring populations support small populations, typically <100 individuals. Such small population sizes suggest spring populations may have heightened probabilities of extirpation. Despite small population sizes, all springs harbor relatively high levels of genetic variation for both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Unexpectedly high levels of variation may be explained by recent declines in population size coupled with rare episodes of gene flow between springs suspected of occurring during flooding events. The inferences gained from the genetic data provide the basis for evaluating current and future restoration plans. The genetic data suggest there is a need to balance the predicted positive effects of restoring hydrological connectivity with the potential negative impacts of providing avenues for the spread of exotic species detrimental to pupfish populations.",am@colorado.edu,2010,10.1007/s10592-010-0077-9,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,BR,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,popsize,,,freshwater,Actinopterygii,United States,California,"1998.02.01,2007.04.01",70140,36.5-182,pre-designed,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,,,chronic,microsat,fin,ethanol,Qiagen tissue kits,NA,PCR,Only temporal with microsats.

A 542-bp-portion of the CR of 200 individuals from four northern and four southern localities was sequenced. The mtDNA CR of E. autumnata contains a substantial amount of variation as a total of 108 mtDNA haplotypes were observed. Between the northern and the southern localities (similar to1100 km), there was a moderate level of genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.128). The amount of variation in the mtDNA CR of E. autumnata was lower in the north than in the south. The reduction in genetic variability may result from a combination of historical bottlenecks that date back to the post-glacial recolonization of Fermoscandia and, present-day bottlenecks due to the northern E. autumnata populations experiencing repeated outbreaks followed by collapse in population size. On a small spatial scale (0.6-19 km), within the northern and southern areas, no genetic differentiation was detected suggesting ongoing gene flow due to the dispersal of E. autumnata females among the localities.

9987,,"Past and present drivers of population structure in a small coastal fish, the European long snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus","Woodall, LC; Koldewey, HJ; Boehm, JT; Shaw, PW","The effective design of species conservation programs is reliant on information such as extant geographic distribution, taxon-specific life-history characteristics, and the relative influence of historic processes and contemporary environmental parameters in shaping population genetic diversity. Seahorses are weak swimmers and have a brooded young, limiting their dispersal potential. They live in sheltered locations, which are physically isolated from each other. Therefore panmixia across their geographic range is unlikely. Hippocampus guttulatus, a seahorse inhabiting European waters, has a geographic range spanning a number of contemporary oceanographic features that are proposed barriers to gene flow. Thus this fish is well-placed to test the contributions of environment and life-history factors in shaping population structuring. This study found that mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA (microsatellite) genotype data are concordant in suggesting that, like many other small fishes in European waters, H. guttulatus extant populations expanded from at least one southern European refugial population. Subsequent population differentiation of four geographic lineages reflects contemporary oceanographic barriers to gene flow. Demographic analyses suggest a northward, and long-term isolation between Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea populations. Moreover H. guttulatus contemporary population distribution and population structure are predominately explained by historic and oceanographic influences. These findings suggest that conservation of genetic diversity in H. guttulatus may be aided by a network of marine protected areas (MPAs), implemented to conserve coastal habitats, but the species' unusual life history and gamete retaining behaviours should be considered as part of management decisions including MPA design and fisheries management plans.",l.woodall@nhm.ac.uk,2015,10.1007/s10592-015-0728-y,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Collected over consecutive years, but couldn't find more information on temporal component/analysis",,,,,,,,,

Previous modeling has suggested that global warming will lead to increased abundance of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the ocean around Greenland, but the dynamics of earlier abundance fluctuations are not well understood. We applied a retrospective spatiotemporal population genomics approach to examine the temporal stability of cod population structure in this region and to search for signatures of divergent selection over a 78-year period spanning major demographic changes. Analyzing >900 gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in 847 individuals, we identified four genetically distinct groups that exhibited varying spatial distributions with considerable overlap and mixture. The genetic composition had remained stable over decades at some spawning grounds, whereas complete population replacement was evident at others. Observations of elevated differentiation in certain genomic regions are consistent with adaptive divergence between the groups, indicating that they may respond differently to environmental variation. Significantly increased temporal changes at a subset of loci also suggest that adaptation may be ongoing. These findings illustrate the power of spatiotemporal population genomics for revealing biocomplexity in both space and time and for informing future fisheries management and conservation efforts.",nthe@stanford.edu,2013,10.1111/eva.12055,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,temporal-genomics,BR,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,adaptation,,,,marine,Actinopterygii,"Greenland, Iceland, Canada","Sisimiut,Danas Banke,Sisimiut,Kapisillit,Uummannaq,Paamiut.Qaqortoq,Store Hellefiskebanke,Ilulissat,Fyllas Banke,Lille Hellefiskebanke,Northeast coastal.Southwest coastal.Southwest offshore,Sisimiut,Danas Banke.Qaqortoq.Paamiut.Ameralik.Qorqut.Kapisillit.Gulf of St Lawrence,Tasiilaq.Offshore East.Offshore South.Offshore West.Sisimiut.Ilulissat.Uummannaq","1932.01.01,1934.01.01,1937.01.01,1943.01.01,1945.01.01,1947.01.01,1950.01.01,1953.01.01,1954.01.01,1957.01.01,2002.01.01,2005.01.01,2008.01.01,2010.01.01","20,31,31,30,30,31.28,31,30,30,31,39.38.39,34,31.27.29.30.30.30.39,29.29.29.39.26.30.25",1825,opportunistic,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,climate_change,,chronic,SNP,bone,dried,Therkildsen et al. 2010,Illumina GoldenGate,PCR,Generation time from the supplementary,,,,,,,,,
3297,,Temporal dynamics of genetic clines of invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas) in eastern North America,"Lehnert, SJ; DiBacco, C; Jeffery, NW; Blakeslee, AMH; Isaksson, J; Roman, J; Wringe, BF; Stanley, RRE; Matheson, K; McKenzie, CH; Hamilton, LC; Bradbury, IR","Two genetically distinct lineages of European green crabs (Carcinus maenas) were independently introduced to eastern North America, the first in the early 19th century and the second in the late 20th century. These lineages first came into secondary contact in southeastern Nova Scotia, Canada (NS), where they hybridized, producing latitudinal genetic clines. Previous studies have documented a persistent southward shift in the clines of different marker types, consistent with existing dispersal and recruitment pathways. We evaluated current clinal structure by quantifying the distribution of lineages and fine-scale hybridization patterns across the eastern North American range (25 locations, similar to 39 to 49 degrees N) using informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; n=96). In addition, temporal changes in the genetic clines were evaluated using mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci (n=9-11) over a 15-year period (2000-2015). Clinal structure was consistent with prior work demonstrating the existence of both northern and southern lineages with a hybrid zone occurring between southern New Brunswick (NB) and southern NS.

However, finer-scale genetic and phenotypic variability may be present within individual basins and can be overlooked in such efforts, even though it may be a critical component for long-term viability. Here, we investigate Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) within the Siletz River, a small coastal watershed in Oregon, USA. Adult Chinook salmon were genotyped using neutral microsatellite markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms and """"adaptive"""" loci, associated with temporal variation in migratory behavior in many salmon populations, to investigate genetic diversity based upon both spatial and temporal variation in migratory and reproductive behavior. Results from all three marker types identified two genetically distinct populations in the basin, corresponding to early returning fish that spawn above a waterfall, a spring-run population, and later returning fish spawning below the waterfall, a fall-run population. This finding is an important consideration for management of the species, as spring-run populations generally only have been recognized in large watersheds, and highlights the need to evaluate population structure of salmon within smaller watersheds, and thereby increase the probability of successful conservation of salmon species.",davischa@oregonstate.edu,2017,10.1007/s10641-017-0616-z,ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,temporal-genetics,RC,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It uses fish collected at different parts of the year as a proxy for different populations.

This goal is particularly worthwhile in an epoch of rampant biotic homogenisation (i.e., the progressive replacement of native biotas with locally expanding non-natives) driven by global change in the context of the ongoing Anthropocene extinction. Under these premises, we provided here a molecular biogeographic framework based on macro-regional scale sampling to support conservation initiatives for the smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata). This species, ranging from Pakistan across the Indian subcontinent and Indochina to Sundaland and occurring also in Iraq and extreme southwestern Iran with an isolated population, has experienced a rapid decline over the last decades and is now listed as 'Vulnerable' by the IUCN. We sequenced a 307 bp-long fragment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome-b (Cyt-b) gene in modem and museum samples (n = 77, of which 23 are new with respect to a previous study) from the entirety of the species range, including holotypes of the three traditionally recognised morphological subspecies (L. p. maxwelli, L. p. sindica, and L. p. perspicillata). We corroborated the occurrence of three patently diverging genetic groups (Middle East, South, and South East Asia) and defined their spatial boundaries. Incidentally, we found that the holotype of L. p. perspicillata from Indonesia (dated 1821) held oriental small-clawed otter (Amyx cinereus) maternal DNA. Although a few evident morphological similarities shared by this specimen with the oriental small-clawed otter cast serious doubts on its current taxonomical identification, it is suggested that the recently disclosed hybridisation in the wild between L. perspicillata and A. cinereus in Singapore might be more geographically extensive and/or have occurred earlier than believed. In conclusion, the molecular biogeographic picture herein is intended to form the basis for supporting management in ex situ facilities (e.g., exchange of individuals among zoos) and for implementing the genetic tracking of illegally traded otters in the attainment of adaptive conservation for L. perspicillata.",filippo.barbanera@unipi.it,2020,10.26107/RBZ-2020-0084,RAFFLES BULLETIN OF ZOOLOGY,historical-dna,KC,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,other,"

5112,,Spatio-temporal patterns of mitochondrial DNA variation in hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in Southeast Asia,"Nishizawa, H; Joseph, J; Chong, YK","Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms provide useful information that can be used to estimate the phylogeographic relationships, historical demography, and migratory events of widely distributed animals. In this study, the spatio-temporal patterns of mtDNA polymorphisms were assessed in Indo-Pacific hawksbill turtles from Malaysian nesting rookeries and foraging aggregations sampled during 1996-2014. Clear genetic differences were observed between turtles from the Sabah Turtle Islands rookery in the Sulu Sea, and the rookeries of Melaka and Redang Island in the South China Sea off the Malay Peninsula; however, no temporal genetic changes were found to have occurred on a decadal time scale. Despite the descriptive evaluation of a few samples, Johor nesting turtles possessed different haplotypes from those at the proximate Melaka rookery, indicating the importance of conserving this small nesting population. Although continuous sampling efforts are needed to determine the relationships between specific rookeries and foraging aggregations, the presence of multiple haplotypes in Malaysian foraging aggregations, in combination with Lagrangian drifter buoy data, suggests that there have been migrations to foraging grounds in Southeast Asia from various rookeries.

11088,,Three-dimensional post-glacial expansion and diversification of an exploited oceanic fish,"Shum, P; Pampoulie, C; Kristinsson, K; Mariani, S","Vertical divergence in marine organisms is being increasingly documented, yet much remains to be carried out to understand the role of depth in the context of phylogeographic reconstruction and the identification of management units. An ideal study system to address this issue is the beaked redfish, Sebastes mentella - one of four species of redfish' occurring in the North Atlantic - which is known for a widely distributed shallow-pelagic' oceanic type inhabiting waters between 250 and 550m, and a more localized deep-pelagic' population dwelling between 550 and 800m, in the oceanic habitat of the Irminger Sea. Here, we investigate the extent of population structure in relation to both depth and geographic spread of oceanic beaked redfish throughout most of its distribution range. By sequencing the mitochondrial control region of 261 redfish collected over a decadal interval, and combining 160 rhodopsin coding nuclear sequences and previously genotyped microsatellite data, we map the existence of two strongly divergent evolutionary lineages with significantly different distribution patterns and historical demography, and whose genetic variance is mostly explained by depth. Combined genetic data, analysed via independent approaches, are consistent with a Late Pleistocene lineage split, where segregation by depth probably resulted from the interplay of climatic and oceanographic processes with life history and behavioural traits. The ongoing process of diversification in North Atlantic S.mentella may serve as an hourglass' to understand speciation and adaptive radiation in Sebastes and in other marine taxa distributed across a depth gradient.",s.mariani@salford.ac.uk,2015,10.1111/mec.13262,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,ACS,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,They have historic samples but no analysis uses the time or really looks at temporal change pertaining to the sampling times.,,,,,,,,,
1966,,Where did the rats of Big South Cape Island come from?,"Robins, JH; Miller, SD; Russell, JC; Harper, GA; Fewster, RM","The ship rat invasion of Big South Cape Island/Taukihepa in the 1960s was an ecological catastrophe that marked a turning point for the management of rodents on offshore islands of New Zealand. Despite the importance of this event in the conservation history of New Zealand, and subsequent major advances in rodent eradication and biosecurity, the source and pathway of the rat invasion of Big South Cape Island has never been identified. Using modern molecular methods on contemporary and historical tissue samples, we identify the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype of ship rats (Rattus rattus) on Big South Cape Island and compare it to that of ship rats in the neighbouring regions of Stewart Island/Rakiura and southern New Zealand, all hypothesised as possible source sites for the invasion. We identify two haplotype clusters, each comprising three closely related haplotypes; one cluster unique to Stewart Island, and the other found in southern New Zealand and elsewhere. By a process of elimination we rule that the ship rat invasion of Big South Cape Island was neither by swimming nor boat transport from Stewart Island, and is unlikely to have come from the south coast ports of New Zealand. However, because the ship rat haplotype found on Big South Cape Island is cosmopolitan to New Zealand's South Island and elsewhere, we can only confirm that the invasion likely originated from some distance, but are not able to identify the invasion source more precisely. An unexpected consequence of our study is the discovery of five new mtDNA haplotypes for R. rattus that have not been previously reported.",j.robins@auckland.ac.nz,2016,10.20417/nzjecol.40.26,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,historical-dna,BR,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,terrestrial,"

Landscape permeability, including partial barriers, influences migratory animals that move across the landscape. Partial barriers are common in rivers where barrier passage varies with streamflow. We explore the influence of partial barriers on the spatial and temporal distribution of migration-linked genotypes of Oncorhynchus mykiss, a salmonid fish with co-occurring resident and migratory forms, in tributaries to the South Fork Eel River, California, USA, Elder and Fox Creeks. We genotyped >4,000 individuals using RAD-capture and classified individuals as resident, heterozygous or migratory genotypes using life history-associated loci. Across four years of study (2014-2017), the permeability of partial barriers varied across dry and wet years. In Elder Creek, the largest waterfall was passable for adults migrating up-river 4-39 days each year. In this stream, the overall spatial pattern, with fewer migratory genotypes above the waterfall, remained true across dry and wet years (67%-76% of migratory alleles were downstream of the waterfall). We also observed a strong relationship between distance upstream and proportion of migratory alleles. In Fox Creek, the primary barrier is at the mouth, and we found that the migratory allele frequency varied with the annual timing of high flow events. In years when rain events occurred during the peak breeding season, migratory allele frequency was high (60%-68%), but otherwise it was low (30% in two years). We highlight that partial barriers and landscape permeability can be temporally dynamic, and this effect can be observed through changing genotype frequencies in migratory animals.",skelson@berkeley.edu,2020,10.1111/mec.15367,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,BR,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,freshwater,Actinopterygii,United States,"Fox Creek.Elder-Below waterfall.Elder-Above waterfall.Elder-Misery.Elder-Paralyze,Fox Creek.Elder-Below waterfall.Elder-Above waterfall.Elder-Misery.Elder-Paralyze,Fox Creek.Elder-Below waterfall.Elder-Above waterfall.Elder-Misery.Elder-Paralyze,Fox Creek.Elder-Below waterfall.Elder-Above waterfall.Elder-Misery.Elder-Paralyze","2014.01.01,2015.01.01,2016.01.01,2017.01.01","45.731.397.87.186,111.242.155.26.76,89.157.180.23.85,127.151.110.29.74",584,pre-designed,natural,env_variation,,,acute,SNP,fin,dried,"Ali et al., 2016",Illumina_HiSeq,RAPTURE,Generation time: Fishbase,,,,,,,,,

We used this approach to test for changes in genomic diversity accompanying a climate-related range retraction in the alpine chipmunks (Tamias alpinus) in the high Sierra Nevada area of California, USA. We developed robust bioinformatic pipelines that rigorously detect and filter out base misincorporations in DNA derived from skins, most of which likely resulted from postmortem damage. Furthermore, to accommodate genotyping uncertainties associated with low-medium coverage data, we applied a recently developed probabilistic method to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms and estimate allele frequencies and the joint site frequency spectrum. Our results show increased genetic subdivision following range retraction, but no change in overall genetic diversity at either nonsynonymous or synonymous sites. This case study showcases the advantages of integrating emerging genomic and statistical tools in museum collection-based population genomic applications. Such technical advances greatly enhance the value of museum collections, even where a pre-existing reference is lacking and points to a broad range of potential applications in evolutionary and conservation biology.",kebi@berkeley.edu,2013,10.1111/mec.12516,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,ancient-dna,BR,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,United States,Yosemite,"1915.01.01,2006.01.01","20,20",365,pre-designed,anthropogenic,climate_change,env_variation,,chronic,SNP,skin,dried,DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen),Illumina_HiSeq,Meyer & Kircher 2010,Generation time: Ingles 1965,,,,,,,,,
141,,Genetic evidence for the persistence of the critically endangered Sierra Nevada red fox in California,"Perrine, JD; Pollinger, JP; Sacks, BN; Barrett, RH; Wayne, RK","California is home to both the native state-threatened Sierra Nevada red fox (Vulpes vulpes necator), which historically inhabited high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains, and to multiple low-elevation red fox populations thought to be of exotic origin. During the past few decades the lowland populations have dramatically expanded their distribution, and possibly moved into the historic range of the native high-elevation fox. To determine whether the native red fox persists in its historic range in California, we compared mitochondrial cytochrome-b haplotypes of the only currently-known high-elevation population (n = 9 individuals) to samples from 3 modern lowland populations (n = 35) and historic (1911-1941) high-elevation (n = 22) and lowland (n = 7) populations. We found no significant population differentiation among the modern and historic high-elevation populations (average pairwise F-ST = 0.06), but these populations differed substantially from all modern and historic lowland populations (average pairwise F-ST = 0.52). Among lowland populations, the historic and modern Sacramento Valley populations were not significantly differentiated from one another (F-ST = -0.06), but differed significantly from recently founded populations in the San Francisco Bay region and in southern California (average pairwise F-ST = 0.42). Analysis of molecular variance indicated that 3 population groupings (mountain, Sacramento Valley, and other lowland regions) explained 45% of molecular variance (F-CT = 0.45) whereas only 4.5% of the variance was partitioned among populations within these groupings (F-SC = 0.08). These findings provide strong evidence that the native Sierra Nevada red fox has persisted in northern California. However, all nine samples from this population had the same haplotype, suggesting that several historic haplotypes may have become lost. Unidentified barriers have apparently prevented gene flow from the Sacramento Valley population to other eastern or southern populations in California. Future studies involving nuclear markers are needed to assess the origin of the Sierra Nevada red fox and to quantify levels of nuclear gene flow.",perrine@nature.berkeley.edu,2007,10.1007/s10592-006-9265-z,CONSERVATION GENETICS,ancient-dna,JW,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,United States,"Siskiyou,Tulare,Mariposa,Mono,Mono,Colusa.Mono,Lassen,Colusa,Mono,Glen.Mono,Siskiyou,Colusa,Nevada,Tehama,Butte,Colusa.Napa,Glen,Butte.Tehama,Glenn,Marin,Tehama,Los Angeles,Los Angeles,Los Angeles.Santa Barbara,Santa Barbara,Santa Barbara,Alameda.Butte.Santa Barbara,Alameda.San Mateo.Santa Barbara,Fesno.San Joaquin.San Mateo,Shasta.Tehama,Kern.Shasta.Tehama,Colusa.Kings.Shasta.Tehama,Butte.Shasta,Los Angeles.Santa Barbara.Yolo,Kern,Glen","1904.01,1911.01.01,1916.01.01,1921.01.01,1922.01.01,1923.01.01,1925.01.01,1926.01.01,1928.01.01,1929.01.01,1934.01.01,1935.01.01,1941.01.01,1948.01.01,1966.01.01,1968.01.01,1969.01.01,1970.01.01,1973.01.01,1982.01.01,1986.01.01,1988.01.01,1989.01.01,1990.01.01,1993.01.01,1994.01.01,1995.01.01,1996.01.01,1997.01.01,1998.01.01,1999.01.01,2000.01.01,2001.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01","1,3,1,1,3,1.5,2,7,2,1.2,2,1,1,1,1,1.1,1,1.1,1,1,1,1,1,1.1,1,1,1.1.1,3.3.1,1.1.1,1.3,1.2.2,1.1.1.2,1.3,1.1,1,1",365,opportunistic,natural,env_variation,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,skin.bones.feces.ear punch,dried,QIAamp minikit (Qiagen),ABI 3730 capillary sequencer.BEckman CEQ2000XL,PCR,Generation time: Lariviere & Pasitschniak-Arts 1996,,,,,,,,,

Particularly nongregarious mammalian species present an underexplored field of study: despite their lower levels of sociality compared to group-living species, interactions among individuals do occur, providing opportunities for cryptic kin selection. Among the least gregarious primates are orang-utans (genus: Pongo), in which preferential associations among females have nevertheless been observed, but for which the presence of kin structures was so far unresolved because of the equivocal results of previous genetic studies. To clarify relatedness and dispersal patterns in orang-utans, we examined the largest longitudinal set of individuals with combined genetic, spatial and behavioural data. We found that males had significantly higher mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and more unique haplotypes, thus underscoring their different maternal ancestries compared to females. Moreover, pedigree reconstruction based on 24 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and mtDNA haplotypes demonstrated the presence of three matrilineal clusters of generally highly related females with substantially overlapping ranges. In orang-utans and possibly other nongregarious species, comparing average biparental relatedness (r) of males and females to infer sex-biased dispersal is extremely problematic. This is because the opportunistic sampling regime frequently employed in nongregarious species, combined with overlapping space use of distinct matrilineal clusters, leads to a strong downward bias when mtDNA lineage membership is ignored. Thus, in nongregarious species, correct inferences of dispersal can only be achieved by combining several genetic approaches with detailed spatial information.",n.arora@aim.uzh.ch,2012,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05608.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,museum-dna,JW,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,Indonesia,Tuanan Orangutan Research Area (Lat/long in SI-rangingdata.csv),"2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2005.01.01,2006.01.01,2007.01.01,2008.01.01,2009.01.01","2893, 6139, 7030, 6214, 6625, 7775, 6103",9125,pre-designed,natural,habitat_loss,,,acute,mtDNA_seq,feces,NA,QUAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen),NA,PCR,Generation time: Wich et al. 2009,,,,,,,,,
789,,Evidence for geographic substructuring of mtDNA variation in the East European Hermit beetle (Osmoderma barnabita),"Landvik, M; Miraldo, A; Niemel, P; Valainis, U; Cibulskis, R; Roslin, T","The genus Osmoderma is a flagship taxon of invertebrate conservation in Europe and encompasses a complex of four accepted species. While species limits amongst Osmoderma have been intensively studied, patterns of intraspecific variation are poorly known. In this paper, the authors focus on clarifying the phylogeographic structure of the East European Osmoderma barnabita using samples from Croatia to Finland. Samples of hind legs were collected from populations in Latvia and Finland (n=186) and combined with previously-published sequences from GenBank and museum specimens (n=10). In a partial sequence of the mitochondrial COI gene (759 bp), 26 closely related haplotypes were found. Beetle samples from different parts of Europe were distinct and showed no overlap in haplotype composition. The solitary population of Finland proved to be monomorphic and all 97 individuals sampled here belonged to a single haplotype unique to this region. The results suggest the Northern parts of Eastern Europe to be dominated by a single COI haplotype to which most of the other haplotypes are linked by one or two mutations. The pattern seems to reflect a founder effect or a strong bottleneck event. While O. barnabita is widely distributed over Eastern Europe, current patterns of mitochondrial genetic diversity appear influenced by population history and little homogenisation by ongoing gene flow. From a conservation perspective, the patterns suggest that regional populations might need to be managed as subunits and that the population of Finland may be affected by low genetic diversity.",matti.landvik@gmail.com,2017,10.3897/natureconservation.19.12877,NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA,historical-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whaling logbooks of 19th century whalers show almost no records of catches in some regions of current concentration, notably eastern Polynesia, suggesting that humpback whales were formerly absent from these regions or that the locations of their primary concentrations were unknown to early whalers. Here we investigate the population structure of humpback whales across the South Pacific and eastern Indian oceans, with an interest in the origins of whales in eastern Polynesia, using an extensive collection of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences obtained from living whales on 6 breeding grounds: New Caledonia, Tonga, Cook Islands, eastern Polynesia (Society Islands of French Polynesia), Colombia and Western Australia. From a total of 1112 samples we sequenced 470 bp of the mtDNA control region, revealing 115 unique haplotypes identified by 71 variable sites. We found significant differentiation, at both the haplotype and nucleotide level (F-ST = 0.033; Phi(ST) = 0.022), among the 6 breeding grounds and for most pair-wise comparisons. The differentiation of the eastern Polynesia humpback whales is consistent with the hypothesis of a relic subpopulation, rather than vagrancy or colonization from known neighboring breeding grounds. Regardless of their origin, it seems probable that islands of eastern Polynesia are now the primary breeding grounds for humpback whales feeding in management Area VI (170 to 120 degrees W) of the Antarctic, as defined by the International Whaling Commission.",scott.baker@oregonstate.edu,2007,10.3354/meps330257,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,historical-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Blanding's Turtle, Emys (=Emydoidea) blandingii, is a long-lived species with a relatively narrow latitudinal distribution centered around the Great Lakes, but extending from Nebraska to Nova Scotia. It is listed as endangered or threatened throughout most of its range mainly due to habitat loss. Microsatellite loci have been predominantly used to test and generate hypotheses concerning the number of evolutionarily significant units and the history of lineage diversification in this species. Here we describe haplotypes from two mitochondrial and three nuclear loci generated from 32 localities across the species' range to provide an additional perspective on existing patterns. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity were low in both sets of loci, with mitochondrial polymorphism comparable to the lowest found in any North American freshwater turtle. Spatial analyses of population differentiation supported the presence of two groups with a boundary in eastern Ontario that is roughly associated with the Appalachian Mountains as proposed by Mockford et al. (Conserv Gen 8:209-219, 2007). We suggest that the low diversity in these loci is likely related to periodic range contractions and expansions associated with glacial cycles and that the two groups recovered result from a deeper history of diversification. Our results are broadly consistent with previously identified range-wide structure and help to reconcile population structure found at smaller spatial scales, outcomes that will better inform conservation decision making for the species.",jordanma@pfw.edu,2019,10.1007/s10592-018-01140-6,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared historic (1894-1906) to modern (1988-2006) genetic variation in 11 populations of warbler finches at 14 microsatellite loci. Although several lines of evidence suggest that Darwin's finches may be in decline, we found that the genetic diversity of warbler finches has not generally declined, and broad-scale patterns of variation remained similar over time. Contrary to expectations, inferred population sizes have generally increased over time (6-8%) as have immigration rates (8-16%), which may reflect a recent increase in the frequency and intensity of El Nino events. Individual island populations showed significant declines (18-19%) and also substantial gains (18-20%) in allelic richness over time. Changes in genetic diversity were correlated with changes in immigration rates, but did not correspond to population size or human disturbance. These results reflect the expected stabilizing properties of whole metapopulations over time. However, the dramatic and unpredictable changes observed in individual populations during this short time interval suggests that care should be taken when monitoring individual population fragments with snapshots of genetic variation.",Heather.L.Farrington@usace.army.mil,2011,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01385.x,EVOLUTION,historical-dna,KC,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,popsize,,,terrestrial,Aves,Ecuador,"Fernandina,Marchena.Santiago,Genoversa.San Cristobal,Pinta.Pinzon,Espanola.Isabela.Santa Cruz,Marchena,Espanola.Genoversa,Santa Cruz,Fernandina.Isabela.Pinta.San Cristobal,Santiago,Pinzon","1896.08.01,1900.08.01,1901.06.01,1902.06.01,1906.01.01,1988.01.01,1992.06.01,1993.06.01,1999.01.01,2000.03.30,2004.01.01","12,22.18,25.20,12.19,18.18.10,8,29.23,15,19.25.19.19,12,19",1095-1825,opportunistic,natural,env_variation,,,acute,microsat,Toe pad,dried,GeneClean Ancient DNA kit (QBiogene),Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer,PCR,"Generation time: Grant & Grant 1992, this has two species of Darwins finches but they do not differentiate the samples so they are lumped together.",,,,,,,,,

In a similar manner, the invasive tea spiny whitefly (TSW) A. camelliae has been expanding over East Asia in recent decades. In this study, the genetic diversity of OSW and TSW and of their important parasitoid wasp Encarsia smithi was investigated in China and Japan to enable more efficient biological control policies. We detected two phylogenetic groups (haplogroups A1 and A2) in OSW and three phylogenetic groups (haplotypes B1 and B2, and haplogroup B3) in TSW in China; however, only a single haplotype was detected in each whitefly species in Japan. Based on historical records and molecular data, OSW was considered to be native to China whereas TSW has probably expanded to China from a more southern location in the last 50 years; China appears to be the source region for OSW and TSW invading Japan. In E. smithi, two phylogenetic groups were detected in Japan: haplotype I, associated with OSW, and haplogroup II mostly associated with TSW, except in two locations. These data support the hypothesis that E. smithi parasitizing TSW in Japan did not originate from the existent population parasitizing OSW but was newly imported into Japan following the invasion of its host.",uesugir@affrc.go.jp,2016,10.1017/S0007485315001030,BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,historical-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The designation of the main flyways of Woodpigeon in Europe and the study of the genetic structure of the populations are necessary for the sustainable management of this species. Both ringing recovery data of Woodpigeons and mtDNA D-loop sequences from 606 individuals sampled across Europe and in Morocco were used in this study. In total, 763 direct recoveries of birds ringed during the breeding season in 1908-2016 were analysed, while D-loop sequences were analysed from 416 birds sampled in 2014-2018 and 190 individuals that had been sampled in 2004-2009 for a preliminary investigation. In the median-joining network of D-loop haplotypes, six haplogroups were identified in Woodpigeons from various biogeographical populations. Certain differences in the frequency of haplogroups were found between resident Woodpigeons of the Iberian Peninsula and migratory birds from Eastern and Northern Europe. Relatively low genetic variability within the D-loop was observed in samples of resident birds from the Balearic Islands and the Iberian Peninsula. No genetic variation was found in resident Woodpigeons breeding in Morocco. The analysis of ringing recovery data and distribution patterns of different haplotypes confirmed that Woodpigeons from the north and east of Europe use the Eastern Atlantic flyway, while birds breeding in Hungary use the Mediterranean flyway. It is likely that Woodpigeons from south-eastern Russia, eastern Ukraine and birds breeding further east use the Black Sea flyway. It was also confirmed that the majority of Woodpigeons breeding in Belgium are resident or short-distance migrants.

The effect of this seasonal variation on the genetic structure of New Zealand's dusky dolphins was examined by sequencing a 473-base pair fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region for 169 individuals from 4 regions along the New Zealand coast. A neighbor-joining phylogeny and an analysis of molecular variance did not support genetic subdivision among regions (phi(sr) = -0.041, P = 0.13). However, nested-clade analysis demonstrated significant evidence for contiguous range expansion and fragmentation along the New Zealand coast. Seasonal movement patterns from Kaikoura to either Otago or the Marlborough Sounds and West Coast are presented as an alternative explanation of nested clade results. New Zealand-wide diversity indices and rate of substitution among sites were used to estimate effective female population size. Lineages-through-time analysis was used to test hypotheses of population growth.

Differences in migratory behaviour or antitropical distribution between right whales in each hemisphere are considered a barrier to gene flow and maintain the current species distinctions and geographical populations. However, these distinctions between populations have remained controversial and no study has included an analysis of all right whales from the three major ocean basins. To address issues of genetic differentiation and relationships among right whales, we have compiled a database of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from right whales representing populations in all three ocean basins that consist of: western North Atlantic E. glacialis, multiple geographically distributed populations of E. australis and the first molecular analysis of historical and recent samples of E. glacialis from the western and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Diagnostic characters, as well as phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses, support the possibility that three distinct maternal lineages exist in right whales, with North Pacific E. glacialis being more closely related to E. australis than to North Atlantic E. glacialis.

Six populations (north-western Atlantic, Brazil, South Africa, Japan, eastern Australia, and western Australia) with low genetic diversity and limited gene flow were identified worldwide, but genetic information for many other geographic areas are still missing. Specifically, this species is listed in several reports as part of the Mediterranean fauna, even if there has been a lack of catches and sightings in recent years in this basin. To clarify the origin of C. taurus individuals caught in the past in the Mediterranean Sea, historical samples were genetically analysed. Nine samples with certain Mediterranean origin were collected from different European museums. DNA was extracted and 600 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region were amplified using eight overlapping species-specific primer pairs. Sequences obtained were aligned with all the haplotypes globally known so far. Genetic analysis revealed the misidentification of one museum specimen. Among the remaining Mediterranean historical samples, three different haplotypes were recovered. Two of them previously observed only in South Africa and one described in both South African and Brazilian populations. Results suggest a genetic relationship between Mediterranean sand tiger sharks and those from the western Indian Ocean. According to previous studies, we hypothesized that, during the Pleistocene, the cold Benguela upwelling barrier was temporarily reduced allowing the passage of C. taurus individuals from the Indian to Atlantic Ocean. After the restoration of this phylogeographic barrier some individuals were trapped in the Atlantic Ocean and probably migrated northward colonizing the western African coasts and the Mediterranean Sea.",v.caputo@univpm.it,2020,10.1002/aqc.3294,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,ancient-dna,KF,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2766,,Sequence capture of ultraconserved elements from bird museum specimens,"McCormack, JE; Tsai, WLE; Faircloth, BC","New DNA sequencing technologies are allowing researchers to explore the genomes of the millions of natural history specimens collected prior to the molecular era. Yet, we know little about how well specific next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques work with the degraded DNA typically extracted from museum specimens. Here, we use one type of NGS approach, sequence capture of ultraconserved elements (UCEs), to collect data from bird museum specimens as old as 120years. We targeted 5060 UCE loci in 27 western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) representing three evolutionary lineages that could be species, and we collected an average of 3749 UCE loci containing 4460 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite older specimens producing fewer and shorter loci in general, we collected thousands of markers from even the oldest specimens. More sequencing reads per individual helped to boost the number of UCE loci we recovered from older specimens, but more sequencing was not as successful at increasing the length of loci. We detected contamination in some samples and determined that contamination was more prevalent in older samples that were subject to less sequencing. For the phylogeny generated from concatenated UCE loci, contamination led to incorrect placement of some individuals. In contrast, a species tree constructed from SNPs called within UCE loci correctly placed individuals into three monophyletic groups, perhaps because of the stricter analytical procedures used for SNP calling. This study and other recent studies on the genomics of museum specimens have profound implications for natural history collections, where millions of older specimens should now be considered genomic resources.",brant@faircloth-lab.org; brant@faircloth-lab.org,2016,10.1111/1755-0998.12466,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,ancient-dna,KF,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This study is concerned with the effect of sample age on sequencing accuracy not any evolutionary forces.,,,,,,,,,
2802,,Source-sink dynamics sustain central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum) in heavily urbanized catchment. ,"Waits, ER; Bagley, MJ; Blum, MJ; McCormick, FH; Lazorchak, JM","1. The influence of spatial structure on population dynamics within river-stream networks is poorly understood. Utilizing spatially explicit analyses of temporal genetic variance, we tested whether persistence of central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum) reflects differences in habitat quality and location within a highly modified urban catchment in southwestern Ohio, U.S.A. 2. Estimates of genetic diversity did not vary with habitat quality. Nevertheless, evidence of weak but temporally stable genetic structure, location-dependent effective population sizes and rates of immigration among sites, together suggest that persistence of central stonerollers within the catchment may be attributable to source-sink dynamics driven by habitat heterogeneity. 3. Under this scenario, migrant-pool colonization from areas of relatively high habitat quality in the upper catchment sustains the presence of central stonerollers at degraded sites in the main stem and dampens population subdivision within the catchment. However, because intact habitat is restricted to the upper portion of the catchment, it is not possible to preclude net downstream dispersal as a mechanism contributing to source-sink dynamics. The slight genetic structure that persists appears to reflect weak isolation by distance diminished by high rates of immigration. 4. This study suggests that without a systems perspective of the conditions that sustain populations in degraded waterways, environmental assessments may underestimate levels of impairment. Conservation and management of stream fishes could be improved by maintaining habitat in areas that are net exporters of migrants or by remediation of impaired habitat.",waits.eric@epa.gov,2008,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02030.x,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,temporal-genetics,KF,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,freshwater,Actinopterygii,United States,Lat/lon available in table 1,"1995.001.01,2001.01.01","22.13.28.22.23,80.10.57.45.48.24.287.103",547.5,pre-designed,natural,env_variation,,,chronic,microsat,fin,frozen,DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen),MJ Basestation Genetic Analyzer,PCR,Generation time: Smith 1979,,,,,,,,,

4286,,Phylogeography of amphi-boreal dish: tracing the history of the Pacific herring Clupea pallasii in North-East European Seas,"Laakkonen, HM; Lajus, DL; Strelkov, P; Vainola, R","Background: The relationships between North Atlantic and North Pacific faunas through times have been controlled by the variation of hydrographic circumstances in the intervening Arctic Ocean and Bering Strait. We address the history of trans-Arctic connections in a clade of amphi-boreal pelagic fishes using genealogical information from mitochondrial DNA sequence data. The Pacific and Atlantic herrings (Clupea pallasii and C. harengus) have basically vicarious distributions in the two oceans since pre-Pleistocene times. However, remote populations of C. pallasii are also present in the border waters of the North-East Atlantic in Europe. These populations show considerable regional and life history differentiation and have been recognized in subspecies classification. The chronology of the inter-oceanic invasions and genetic basis of the phenotypic structuring however remain unclear. Results: The Atlantic and Pacific herrings both feature high mtDNA diversities (large long-term population sizes) in their native basins, but an ocean-wide homogeneity of C. harengus is contrasted by deep east-west Pacific subdivision within Pacific C. pallasii. The outpost populations of C. pallasii in NE Europe are identified as members of the western Pacific C. pallasii clade, with some retained inter-oceanic haplotype sharing. They have lost diversity in colonization bottlenecks, but have also thereafter accumulated abundant new variation. The data delineate three phylogeographic groups within the European C. pallasii: herring from the inner White Sea; herring from the Mezen and Chesha Bays; and a strongly bottlenecked peripheral population in Balsfjord of the Norwegian Sea. Conclusions: The NE European outposts of C. pallasii are judged to be early post-glacial colonists from the NW Pacific. A strong regional substructure has evolved since that time, in contrast to the apparent broad-scale uniformity maintained by herrings in their native basins. The structure only partly matches the previous biological concepts based on seasonal breeding stocks or geographical subspecies designations. The trans-Arctic herring phylogeography is notably similar to those of the amphi-boreal mollusk taxa Macoma and Mytilus, suggesting similar histories of inter-oceanic connections. We also considered the time dependency of molecular rates, critical for interpreting timing of relatively recent biogeographical events, by comparing the estimates from coding and non-coding mitochondrial regions of presumably different mutation dynamics.",hanna.laakkonen@helsinki.fi,2013,10.1186/1471-2148-13-67,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,historical-dna,RC,AAS,reject,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LocationHistorical and modern-day solenodon specimens were analysed from sampling localities across Hispaniola, representing this geotectonically complex island's distinct northern, south-eastern and south-western biogeographic provinces. MethodsWe successfully amplified mitochondrial cytochrome b and control region sequences from 34 solenodon samples. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were applied to assess the relationship between these sequence data, and coalescent simulation and approximate Bayesian computation were used to identify which model of solenodon intra-island demographic history best explains the observed patterns of variation. We also conducted morphometric analysis of 110 solenodon specimens to investigate whether allopatric Hispaniolan populations can be differentiated using craniodental characteristics. ResultsUnique haplotypes were identified in solenodon samples from each biogeographic region, with no haplotype sharing between regions. Higher marginal posterior probability values were found for a three-population model comprising allopatric northern, south-eastern and south-western Hispaniolan populations, with exceptionally low migration rates inferred between all populations, indicating that they are genetically isolated. Modal estimates of long-term effective female population size are extremely low for south-western and south-eastern populations. Morphometric differentiation is observed between all three populations. Main conclusionsEvolutionary differentiation of Hispaniolan solenodons into three distinct populations is congruent with phylogenetic patterns observed in several other Hispaniolan species, with population isolation possibly associated with past marine transgression. We interpret these populations as distinct subspecies, with the two genetically impoverished southern subspecies particularly vulnerable to environmental change. Our improved understanding of Hispaniolan solenodon evolutionary history provides an important baseline for identifying wider patterns of intra-island diversification and prioritizing conservation attention for evolutionarily significant populations.",stuart.peters.13@ucl.ac.uk,2016,10.1111/ddi.12420,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,temporal-genetics,RC,AAS,reject,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known of their genetic diversity. This study investigates that question as well as that of Middle East brown bear relationships to surrounding populations of the species. Location Middle East region of south-western Asia. Methods We performed DNA analyses on 27 brown bear individuals. Twenty ancient bone samples (Late Pleistocene to 20th century) from natural populations and seven present-day samples obtained from captive individuals were analysed. Results Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial sequences obtained from seven ancient specimens identify three distinct maternal clades, all unrelated to one recently described from North Africa. Brown bears from Iran exhibit striking diversity (three individuals, three haplotypes) and form a unique clade that cannot be linked to any extant one. Individuals from Syria belong to the Holarctic clade now observed in Eastern Europe, Turkey, Japan and North America. Specimens from Lebanon surprisingly appear as tightly linked to the clade of brown bears now in Western Europe. Moreover, we show that U. a. syriacus in captivity still harbour haplotypes closely linked to those found in ancient individuals. Main conclusion This study brings important new information on the genetic diversity of brown bear populations at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa.

This knowledge of population and species-level responses to climatic variables can then be used to predict the potential consequences of ongoing climate change. The aim of this study was to predict responses of Rana temporaria to environmental change in Scotland by inferring historical and contemporary patterns of gene flow in relation to current variation in local thermal conditions. We first inferred colonization patterns within Europe following the last glacial maximum by combining new and previously published mitochondrial DNA sequences. We found that sequences from our Scottish samples were identical to (92%), or clustered with, the common haplotype previously identified from Western Europe. This clade showed very low mitochondrial variation, which did not allow inference of historical colonization routes but did allow interpretation of patterns of current fine-scale population structure without consideration of confounding historical variation. Second, we assessed fine-scale microsatellite-based patterns of genetic variation in relation to current altitudinal temperature gradients. No population structure was found within altitudinal gradients (average F-ST=0.02), despite a mean annual temperature difference of 4.5 degrees C between low- and high-altitude sites. Levels of genetic diversity were considerable and did not vary between sites. The panmictic population structure observed, even along temperature gradients, is a potentially positive sign for R.temporaria persistence in Scotland in the face of a changing climate. This study demonstrates that within taxonomic groups, thought to be at high risk from environmental change, levels of vulnerability can vary, even within species.",a.muir.2@research.gla.ac.uk,2013,10.1111/mec.12334,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,JW,AAS,reject,accept,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examine processes shaping population divergence in highly mobile species by reassessing the case of panmixia in the iconic olive ridley turtle from the eastern Pacific. We implemented a biophysical model of connectivity and a seascape genetic analysis based on nuclear DNA variation of 634 samples collected from 27 nesting areas. Two genetically distinct populations largely isolated during reproductive migrations and mating were detected, each composed of multiple nesting sites linked by high connectivity. This pattern was strongly associated with a steep environmental gradient and also influenced by ocean currents. These findings relate to meso-scale features of a dynamic oceanographic interface in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) region, a scenario that possibly provides different cost-benefit solutions and selective pressures for sea turtles during both the mating and migration periods. We reject panmixia and propose a new paradigm for olive ridley turtles where reproductive isolation due to assortative mating is linked to its environment. Our study demonstrates the relevance of integrative approaches for assessing the role of environmental gradients and oceanographic currents as drivers of genetic differentiation in widely distributed marine species.

However, so far, the number of practical cases of marine fisheries management using genetics has been limited. Here, we used Atlantic cod in the Baltic Sea to demonstrate the applicability of genetics to a complex management scenario involving mixing of two genetically divergent populations. Specifically, we addressed several assumptions used in the current assessment of the two populations. Through analysis of 483 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the Atlantic cod genome, we confirmed that a model of mechanical mixing, rather than hybridization and introgression, best explained the pattern of genetic differentiation. Thus, the fishery is best monitored as a mixed-stock fishery. Next, we developed a targeted panel of 39 SNPs with high statistical power for identifying population of origin and analyzed more than 2,000 tissue samples collected between 2011 and 2015 as well as 260 otoliths collected in 2003/2004. These data provided high spatial resolution and allowed us to investigate geographical trends in mixing, to compare patterns for different life stages and to investigate temporal trends in mixing. We found similar geographical trends for the two time points represented by tissue and otolith samples and that a recently implemented geographical management separation of the two populations provided a relatively close match to their distributions. In contrast to the current assumption, we found that patterns of mixing differed between juveniles and adults, a signal likely linked to the different reproductive dynamics of the two populations. Collectively, our data confirm that genetics is an operational tool for complex fisheries management applications.

10059,,"Parapatric genetic divergence among deep evolutionary lineages in the Mediterranean green crab, Carcinus aestuarii (Brachyura, Portunoidea, Carcinidae), accounts for a sharp phylogeographic break in the Eastern Mediterranean","Deli, T; Kalkan, E; Karhan, SU; Uzunova, S; Keikhosravi, A; Bilgin, R; Schubart, CD","Background: Recently, population genetic studies of Mediterranean marine species highlighted patterns of genetic divergence and phylogeographic breaks, due to the interplay between impacts of Pleistocene climate shifts and contemporary hydrographical barriers. These factors markedly shaped the distribution of marine organisms and their genetic makeup. The present study is part of an ongoing effort to understand the phylogeography and evolutionary history of the highly dispersive Mediterranean green crab, Carcinus aestuarii (Nardo, 1847), across the Mediterranean Sea. Recently, marked divergence between two highly separated haplogroups (genetic types I and II) of C. aestuarii was discerned across the Siculo-Tunisian Strait, suggesting an Early Pleistocene vicariant event. In order to better identify phylogeographic patterns in this species, a total of 263 individuals from 22 Mediterranean locations were analysed by comparing a 587 basepair region of the mitochondrial gene Cox1 (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1). The examined dataset is composed of both newly generated sequences (76) and previously investigated ones (187). Results: Our results unveiled the occurrence of a highly divergent haplogroup (genetic type III) in the most north-eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. Divergence between the most distinct type III and the common ancestor of both types I and II corresponds to the Early Pleistocene and coincides with the historical episode of separation between types I and II. Our results also revealed strong genetic divergence among adjacent regions (separating the Aegean and Marmara seas from the remaining distribution zone) and confirmed a sharp phylogeographic break across the Eastern Mediterranean. The recorded parapatric genetic divergence, with the potential existence of a contact zone between both groups in the Ionian Sea and notable differences in the demographic history, suggest the likely impact of paleoclimatic events, as well as past and contemporary oceanographic processes, in shaping genetic variability of this species. Conclusions: Our findings not only provide further evidence for the complex evolutionary history of the green crab in the Mediterranean Sea, but also stress the importance of investigating peripheral areas in the species' distribution zone in order to fully understand the distribution of genetic diversity and unravel hidden genetic units and local patterns of endemism.",Christoph.Schubart@ur.de,2018,10.1186/s12862-018-1167-4,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,historical-dna,JW,AAS,reject,phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10698,,The population history of extant and extinct hyenas,"Rohland, N; Pollack, JL; Nagel, D; Beauval, C; Airvaux, J; Paabo, S; Hofreiter, M","We have analyzed partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from extant striped, brown, and spotted hyenas as well as from Pleistocene cave hyenas. Sequences of the Pleistocene cave hyenas from Eurasia and modern spotted hyenas from Africa are intermixed in phylogenetic analyses, questioning any taxonomic delineation between the two groups. Contrary to cave hyenas in Eurasia, spotted hyenas in Africa show a phylogeographic pattern with little geographical overlap between two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clades, suggesting two Pleistocene refugia in the north and south of Africa. Our results, furthermore, suggest three waves of migration from Africa to Eurasia for spotted hyenas, around 3, 1, and 0.3 MYA. A recent emigration of striped hyenas from Africa to Eurasia took place less than 0.1 MYA, resulting in a dramatic expansion of the geographical range of striped hyenas. In striped hyenas and within the geographical range of mtDNA clades in spotted hyenas, we found identical sequences several thousand kilometers apart, indicating a high rate of migration during the Pleistocene as well as the Holocene. Both striped and brown hyenas show low amounts of genetic diversity, with the latter ones displaying just a single haplotype.",hofreiter@eva.mpg.de,2005,10.1093/molbev/msi244,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ancient-dna,JW,AAS,reject,phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10833,,Post-glacial colonization of eastern Europe from the Carpathian refugium: evidence from mitochondrial DNA of the common vole Microtus arvalis,"Stojak, J; McDevitt, AD; Herman, JS; Searle, JB; Wojcik, JM","There is now considerable evidence for the survival of temperate species within glacial refugia that were situated at relatively high latitudes, notably the Carpathian Basin and Dordogne region in Europe. However, the prevalence of fossil remains in such locations is rarely matched by molecular evidence for their contribution to subsequent geographical and demographic expansion of the species in question. One obstacle to this has been insufficient analysis of modern samples from the relevant areas, in particular the parts of eastern Europe that surround the Carpathian refugium. In the present study, we examine the patterns of variation in mitochondrial DNA of the common vole (Microtus arvalis), obtained from existing museum specimens and from newly-collected samples obtained in this area. We show that common voles from one of six extant mitochondrial DNA lineages have colonized most of the species' range in eastern Europe. We contend that the post-glacial dispersal of this lineage most likely originated from the Carpathian refugium, adding support to the argument that such northern refugia made an important contribution to existing genetic diversity in Europe.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London,",jstojak@ibs.bialowieza.pl,2015,10.1111/bij.12535,BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,museum-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1229,,"Modern and ancient red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in Europe show an unusual lack of geographical and temporal structuring, and differing responses within the carnivores to historical climatic change","Teacher, AGF; Thomas, JA; Barnes, I","Background: Despite phylogeographical patterns being well characterised in a large number of species, and generalised patterns emerging, the carnivores do not all appear to show consistent trends. While some species tend to fit with standard theoretical phylogeographic expectations (e. g. bears), others show little obvious modern phylogeographic structure (e. g. wolves). In this study we briefly review these studies, and present a new phylogeographical study of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) throughout Europe, using a combination of ancient DNA sequences obtained from museum specimens, and modern sequences collated from GenBank. We used cytochrome b (250 bp) and the mitochondrial control region (268 bp) to elucidate both current and historical phylogeographical patterning. Results: We found evidence for slight isolation by distance in modern populations, as well as differentiation associated with time, both of which can likely be attributed to random genetic drift. Despite high sequence diversity (11.2% cytochrome b, 16.4% control region), no evidence for spatial structure (from Bayesian trees) is found either in modern samples or ancient samples for either gene, and Bayesian skyline plots suggested little change in the effective population size over the past 40,000 years. Conclusions: It is probable that the high dispersal ability and adaptability of the red fox has contributed to the lack of observable differentiation, which appears to have remained consistent over tens of thousands of years. Generalised patterns of how animals are thought to have responded to historical climatic change are not necessarily valid for all species, and so understanding the differences between species will be critical for predicting how species will be affected by future climatic change.",amber.teacher@helsinki.fi,2011,10.1186/1471-2148-11-214,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,ancient-dna,EG,AAS,reject,ancient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,exception?

Using craniometry and two mitochondrial DNA fragments (16S rDNA and cytochrome b), we were able to classify most investigated specimens according to the current taxonomy (viz. Crossarchus obscurus, C. platycephalus, C. alexandri and C. ansorgei). Interestingly, all the specimens from CAR clustered unambiguously with Crossarchus alexandri in the DNA-based analyses but exhibited skull dimensions that were distinct from the four recognized species.

1878,,Mitochondrial DNA reveals a mosaic pattern of phylogeographical structure in Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus),"Magoulas, A; Castilho, R; Caetano, S; Marcato, S; Patarnello, T","This study extends the geographic coverage of a previous study of mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism in European anchovy. Both studies together include 24 samples representing 17 localities extending from the Black Sea, through the Mediterranean Sea to the eastern Atlantic as far south as Dakar, Senegal. Eighty-eight haplotypes define two clades (A and B) separated by 3.2% sequence divergence. Clade A has a star-like genealogy indicative of a recent population expansion. Clade B has a more complex genealogy, consisting of several haplotypes at intermediate frequencies. The distributions of these clades consist of a mosaic with abrupt changes between some areas and gradients between other areas. Clade A predominates the Black and Aegean seas, but is present throughout the Mediterranean. Unexpectedly, new data show that clade A is also at a high frequency in the Atlantic, from Portugal to at least Senegal. Overall, the level of genetic differentiation among populations is high (FST = 0. 148, p < 0.0001), with the greatest differences between basins. AMOVA reveals four main geographical groups: Atlantic, central Mediterranean, Aegean Sea, and Black Sea. Mismatch distribution clearly indicates historical bottleneck and population expansion for clade A, while for clade B such evidence is equivocal. This difference may reflect a range expansion for both clades, but with higher gene flow (Nm values) between demes for clade A. Both contemporary and historical processes are important in shaping the complex genetic population structure of European anchovy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

2886,,Genetic landscape with sharp discontinuities shaped by complex demographic history in moose ( Alces alces ),"Wennerstrom, L; Ryman, N; Tison, JL; Hasslow, A; Dalen, L; Laikre, L","The moose (Alces alces) is the most intensely managed game species in Fennoscandia; approximately one-third of the population, ca. 160,000 animals, is harvested annually. Despite the species' biological and socioeconomic importance, there are knowledge gaps with respect to its intraspecific diversity and genetic structure. Recent studies of moose in neighboring countries report 2 genetic groups in Finland, 3 in Norway with one of them suggested to be of ancient origin, and no indications of bottlenecks. To delineate the spatial genetic landscape of the Swedish moose, we used allozyme variability from over 20,000 georeferenced moose collected all over Sweden in combination with 12 microsatellites (n = 1,200) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (n = 44). We combined individual-based and traditional statistical approaches with coalescence-based simulations. The results indicate a complex history with bottlenecks and recent expansions that is consistent with historical records. Swedish moose are separated into 2 major genetic groups, a northern and a southern one, where the southern group is further divided into 3 subgroups. The 2 main subpopulations are moderately differentiated (F-ST = 0.1; R-ST = 0.07) and separated by sharp genetic discontinuities occurring over a relatively narrow transition zone in central Sweden that coincides with a similar, previously reported transition zone in Norway. This differentiation is not reflected in mtDNA variation, where no significant divergence was observed. Together with the F-ST andR(ST) similarities, this suggests that the 2 major subpopulations in Sweden reflect divergence shaped after the postglacial recolonization of Scandinavia. Neighborhood size assessments indicate that gene flow is relatively restricted with an estimated average dispersal distance of 3.5-11.1 km, and spatial autocorrelograms suggest that genetic similarity decreases almost linearly over space resulting in continuous genetic clines within major subgroups. Management areas largely coincide with genetic clusters, simplifying the integration of genetic information into management.",lovisa.wennerstrom@zoologi.su.se,2016,10.1093/jmammal/gyv146,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,ancient-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2512,,Causations of phylogeographic barrier of some rocky shore species along the Chinese coastline,"Wang, J; Tsang, LM; Dong, YW","Background: Substrate, ocean current and freshwater discharge are recognized as important factors that control the larval dispersal and recruitment of intertidal species. Life history traits of individual species will determine the differential responses to these physical factors, and hence resulting in contrasting phylogeography across the same biogeographic barrier. To determine how these factors affect genetic structure of rocky shore species along the China coast, a comparative phylogeographic study of four intertidal and subtidal species was conducted using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA by combining new sequences from Siphonaria japonica with previously published sequences from three species (Cellana toreuma, Sargassum horneri and Atrina pectinata). Results: Analysis of molecular variance and pairwise FST revealed significant genetic differences between the Yellow Sea (YS) and the other two marginal seas (East China Sea, ECS and South China Sea, SCS) for rocky-shore species (S. japonica, C. toreuma, S. horneri), but not for muddy-shore species Atrina pectinata. Demographic history analysis proved that the population size of all these four species were persistent though the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, similar to 20 ka BP). Migration analysis revealed that gene flow differentiated northward and southward migration for these four species. However, the inferred direction of gene flow using alternatively mitochondrial or nuclear markers was contradictory in S. japonica. Conclusions: It is concluded that there is a phylogeographical break at the Yangtze River estuary for the rocky shore species and the causation of the barrier is mainly due to the unsuitable substratum and freshwater discharge. All four intertidal and subtidal species appear to have persisted through the LGM in China, indicating the lower impact of LGM on intertidal and subtidal species than generally anticipated. The imbalanced gene flow between YS and ESCS groups for these four species could be explained by historical refugia. The discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers in the MIGRATE analysis of S. japonica prove the importance of employing multi-locus data in biogeographic study. Climate change, land reclamation and dam construction, which are changing substrate and hydrological conditions around Yangtze River estuary, will consequently affect the biogeographic pattern of intertidal species.",dongyw@xmu.edu.cn,2015,10.1186/s12862-015-0387-0,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,historical-dna,KC,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10198,,Are low but statistically significant levels of genetic differentiation in marine fishes ‘biologically meaningful’? A case study of coastal Atlantic cod,"Knutsen, H; Olsen, EM; Jorde, PE; Espeland, SH; Andre, C; Stenseth, NC","A key question in many genetic studies on marine organisms is how to interpret a low but statistically significant level of genetic differentiation. Do such observations reflect a real phenomenon, or are they caused by confounding factors such as unrepresentative sampling or selective forces acting on the marker loci? Further, are low levels of differentiation biologically trivial, or can they represent a meaningful and perhaps important finding? We explored these issues in an empirical study on coastal Atlantic cod, combining temporally replicated genetic samples over a 10-year period with an extensive capture-mark-recapture study of individual mobility and population size. The genetic analyses revealed a pattern of differentiation between the inner part of the fjord and the open skerries area at the fjord entrance. Overall, genetic differentiation was weak (average F-ST = 0.0037), but nevertheless highly statistical significant and did not depend on particular loci that could be subject to selection. This spatial component dominated over temporal change, and temporal replicates clustered together throughout the 10-year period. Consistent with genetic results, the majority of the recaptured fish were found close to the point of release, with < 1% of recaptured individuals dispersing between the inner fjord and outer skerries. We conclude that low levels of genetic differentiation in this marine fish can indeed be biologically meaningful, corresponding to separate, temporally persistent, local populations.

Genetic rescue by gene flow from a more diverse or differentiated source population of the same species can be an effective strategy for alleviating inbreeding depression and boosting evolutionary potential. The helmeted honeyeater Lichenostomus melanops cassidix is a critically endangered subspecies of the common yellow-tufted honeyeater. Cassidix has declined to a single wild population of similar to 130 birds, despite being subject to intensive population management over recent decades. We assessed changes in microsatellite diversity in cassidix over the last four decades and used population viability analysis to explore whether genetic rescue through hybridization with the neighbouring Lichenostomus melanops gippslandicus subspecies constitutes a viable conservation strategy. The contemporary cassidix population is characterized by low genetic diversity and effective population size (N-e<50), suggesting it is vulnerable to inbreeding depression and will have limited capacity to evolve to changing environments. We find that gene flow from gippslandicus to cassidix has declined substantially relative to pre-1990 levels and argue that natural levels of gene flow between the two subspecies should be restored. Allowing gene flow (similar to 4 migrants per generation) from gippslandicus into cassidix (i.e. genetic rescue), in combination with continued annual release of captive-bred cassidix (i.e. demographic rescue), should lead to positive demographic and genetic outcomes. Although we consider the risk of outbreeding depression to be low, we recommend that genetic rescue be managed within the context of the captive breeding programme, with monitoring of outcomes.",katherine.harrisson@gmail.com,2016,10.1111/mec.13547,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,museum-dna,KF,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,popsize,,,yes,terrestrial,Aves,Australia,NA,"1990.01.01,1991.01.01,1998.01.01,2006.06.01,2011.06.01","25,47,22,17,36",1095,opportunistic,natural,habitat_loss,,,acute,microsat,blood.tissue,"ethanol, frozen",Qiagen.Harrisson et al. 2012,Li-Cor 4200.4300 Global IR2,PCR,Generation time: Smales et al. 2009,,,,,,,,,
9273,,A Genome-Wide Perspective on the Persistence of Red Wolf Ancestry in Southeastern Canids,"Heppenheimer, E; Brzeski, KE; Hinton, JW; Chamberlain, MJ; Robinson, J; Wayne, RK; vonHoldt, BM","The red wolf (Canis rufus), a legally recognized and critically endangered wolf, is known to interbreed with coyotes (Canis latrans). Declared extirpated in the wild in 1980, red wolves were reintroduced to northeastern North Carolina nearly a decade later. Interbreeding with coyotes was thought to be restricted to a narrow geographic region adjacent to the reintroduced population and largely believed to threaten red wolf recovery. However, red wolf ancestry was recently discovered in canids along the American Gulf Coast, igniting a broader survey of ancestry in southeastern canid populations. Here, we examine geographic and temporal patterns of genome-wide red wolf ancestry in 260 canids across the southeastern United States at over 164 000 SNP loci. We found that red wolf ancestry was most prevalent in canids sampled from Texas in the mid-1970s, although non-trivial amounts of red wolf ancestry persist in this region today.

Analyses were carried out on 128 and 138 individuals collected from 5 locations along the range of distribution using mitochondrial ATPase (843 bp) and COI (663 bp) sequences respectively. Significant connectivity and gene flow was detected among fishes collected from all the geographic locations as indicated by lack of structuring in Bayesian clustering analysis along with insignificant phi(ST) values. Oceanographic features of the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and Andaman Sea may be favorable for the dispersal of anchovy larvae and subsequent gene flow. Historical demographic analyses indicated a demographic and spatial expansion taken place approximately during 125,000 years before present, the Pleistocene epoch. Indian Ocean witnessed emergence of upwelling events and consequent increase in productivity during the Pleistocene epoch causing a demographic and spatial expansion of anchovies.

8538,,"Conservation implications of long-distance migration routes: Regional metapopulation structure, asymmetrical dispersal, and population declines","Szczys, P; Oswald, SA; Arnold, JM","Understanding and conserving metapopulations of long-distance migrants is challenging since breeding population structure may not be delimited simply by geography, but also by migration or wintering distributions. We present the first study of the relative importance of breeding, migration and wintering distributions for regional metapopulation processes in breeding areas. Using a species for which life-history and demography are extensively studied (common terns Sterna hirundo), we explored population genetics across eastern North America to distinguish between these potential drivers of metapopulation structure, understand recent population declines in inland areas, and direct appropriate conservation efforts. We analyzed nuclear and mitochondrial DNA to determine changes in population structure and dispersal over prehistoric, historical and contemporary time at regional, sub-regional and local spatial scales. We found evidence for conservation-relevant, hierarchical metapopulation structure within breeding areas: at (i) local and sub-regional scales resulting from restricted dispersal distances, and (ii) between inland and coastal regions as a result of non-breeding distributions. Crucially, at regional scales (ii), asymmetrical dispersal rates from inland to coastal colonies have increased ten-fold since the 1960s, contributing to recent, largely-enigmatic inland population declines. Migrating inland common terns pass over coastal colonies but the reverse is not true. Thus, asymmetrical dispersal from inland to coastal areas provides the first demonstration that migration routes, not wintering distributions, are drivers of breeding population structure in the absence of physical barriers. Our results illustrate the conservation importance of this determination for long-distance migrants: definitive evidence connecting metapopulation demographics to regional population declines for common terns, previously only speculated at despite >100 years of banding effort.

916,,Mitogenomes of the four Agathymus holotypes collected 55 years ago,"Zhang, J; Cong, Q; Shen, JH; Grishin, NV","Giant-Skipper butterflies from the genus Agathymus (family Hesperiidae) are unusual as their caterpillars feed inside Agave leaves. Relationships among Agathymus taxa and their names (i.e. if they are species, subspecies, or synonyms) are poorly understood due to phenotypic similarity. DNA sequences are promising to clarify the taxonomic questions, but it is challenging to sequence name-bearing types that are usually old specimens with poorly preserved DNA. Using next generation sequencing, we assembled mitochondrial genomes of four Agathymus mariae group holotype specimens collected more than 55 years ago and housed pinned and dry in the American Museum of Natural History (New York, NY). We compared the holotype mitogenomes to those we obtained from fresh A. mariae specimens and the sister species Agathymus micheneri. All but A. micheneri mitogenomes were highly similar to each other (more than 99% identity), suggesting that the four names chinatiensis, lajitaensis, rindgei, and gilberti proposed by H. A. Freeman in 1964 may not refer to species-level taxa. The mitogenomes grouped eastern populations (rindgei and gilberti) together and apart from the western populations (nominal mariae, chinatiensis, and lajitaensis). Mexican A. micheneri differs by about 2.5% (about 5% in the COI barcode region) from A. mariae, and is likely to be a distinct species.",grishin@chop.swmed.edu,2017,10.1080/23802359.2017.1372701,MITOCHONDRIAL DNA PART B-RESOURCES,museum-dna,AAS,AAS,reject,phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4912,,Evidence from Genetic Markers Suggests Seasonal Variation in Dispersal in Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae),"Han, Q; Caprio, MA","Spatial and temporal variation in the genetic structure of local populations of tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens (F.) were surveyed using 11 polymorphic allozyme and 36 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-polymerase chain reaction markers. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were calculated from male moths caught in pheromone traps from 5 to 6 local populations from 1995 to 1997. Overall, populations showed little spatial differentiation that indicates a high effective gene flow rate over the spatial scale under investigation. The data show that allelic differentiation arose more frequently in the second generation than in any other generation, suggesting that dispersal was more limited during this period of the summer. Based on allozyme data, estimates of Wright's standardized genetic variance among Populations, F-ST, ranged from 0.001 to 0.018, with the highest values found from the second generation. Estimates based on bootstrapping over loci suggested that genetic variance among populations was significantly higher in the second generation than other generations. Genetic variance tended to increase progressively through the season, peaking in the second generation and decreasing in the latter part of the summer. This temporal pattern of genetic structure is concomitant with changes in gene flow rates and may be influenced by phenological changes in the primary host plants. The F-ST estimates and average heterozygosity from RAPD markers were consistently higher than those estimated from allozyme markers. However, patterns of change over the course of the summer were similar, and the two types of genetic markers provide similar insights into the dispersal biology of H. virescens.",mcaprio@entomology.msstate.edu,2004,10.1603/0046-225X-33.5.1223,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,temporal-genetics,AAS,AAS,reject,non-genomic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Allozymes,,,,,,,,,
5182,,"Unravelling the peculiarities of island life: vicariance, dispersal and the diversification of the extinct and extant giant Gala´pagos tortoises","Poulakakis, N; Russello, M; Geist, D; Caccone, A","In isolated oceanic islands, colonization patterns are often interpreted as resulting from dispersal rather than vicariant events. Such inferences may not be appropriate when island associations change over time and new islands do not form in a simple linear trend. Further complexity in the phylogeography of ocean islands arises when dealing with endangered taxa as extinctions, uncertainty on the number of evolutionary units, and human activities can obscure the progression of colonization events. Here, we address these issues through a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of giant Galapagos tortoises, integrating DNA data from extinct and extant species with information on recent human activities and newly available geological data. Our results show that only three of the five extinct or nearly extinct species should be considered independent evolutionary units. Dispersal from mainland South America started at approximately 3.2 Ma after the emergence of the two oldest islands of San Cristobal and Espanola. Dispersal from older to younger islands began approximately 1.74 Ma and was followed by multiple colonizations from different sources within the archipelago. Vicariant events, spurred by island formation, coalescence, and separation, contributed to lineage diversifications on Pinzon and Floreana dating from 1.26 and 0.85 Ma. This work provides an example of how to reconstruct the history of endangered taxa in spite of extinctions and human-mediated dispersal events and highlights the need to take into account both vicariance and dispersal when dealing with organisms from islands whose associations are not simply explained by a linear emergence model.",poulakakis@nhmc.uoc.gr,2012,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05370.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,AAS,AAS,reject,phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6550,,Characterizing the molecular variation among American marten (Martes americana) subspecies from Oregon and California,"Slauson, KM; Zielinski, WJ; Stone, KD","We investigated the subspecific identity of a rediscovered population of American martens within the range of a presumed extinct subspecies ( Martes americana humboldtensis) by comparing mitochondrial DNA sequence diversity from contemporary individuals within the described ranges of M. a. humboldtensis, nearby ranges of M. a. caurina and M. a. sierrae, and a museum specimen of M. a. humboldtensis. Martens from the rediscovered population shared a haplotype (#2) with the museum specimen. This haplotype was found only in the coastal regions of Oregon and California, suggesting that the rediscovered population represents descendants of a relictual population that previously existed in coastal California. The subspecific boundary between M. a. humboldtensis and M. a. caurina may not be valid, because haplotype #2 was shared between coastal Oregon and coastal California populations and no known contemporary or historical biogeographic barriers prevent north-south movement. Thus, marten populations currently located in coastal forests of California and Oregon should be managed collectively to preserve the connectivity that our data suggest occurred historically. M. a. sierrae differed substantially from both M. a. humboldtensis and M. a. caurina, suggesting marten populations were not a historically genetically homogeneous population and divergence may have occurred in separate glacial refugia.",kslauson@fs.fed.us,2009,10.1007/s10592-008-9626-x,CONSERVATION GENETICS,historical-dna,AAS,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present phylogenetic analyses based on genomewide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of an enigmatic avian radiation, the subspecies complex of Afrocanarian blue tits (Cyanistes teneriffae). The two sister species, the Eurasian blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) and the azure tit (Cyanistes cyanus), constituted the out-group. We generated a large data set of SNPs for analysis of population structure and phylogeny. We also adapted our protocol to utilize degraded DNA from old museum skins from Libya. We found strong population structuring that largely confirmed subspecies monophyly and constructed a coalescent-based phylogeny with full support at all major nodes. The results are consistent with a recent hypothesis that La Palma and Libya are relic populations of an ancient Afrocanarian blue tit, although a small data set for Libya could not resolve its position relative to La Palma. The birds on the eastern islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote are similar to those in Morocco. Together they constitute the sister group to the clade containing the other Canary Islands (except La Palma), in which El Hierro is sister to the three central islands. Hence, extant Canary Islands populations seem to originate from multiple independent colonization events. We also found population divergences in a key reproductive trait, viz. sperm length, which may constitute reproductive barriers between certain populations. We recommend a taxonomic revision of this polytypic species, where several subspecies should qualify for species rank.",jostein.gohli@gmail.com,2015,10.1111/mec.13008,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,ancient-dna,ACS,AAS,reject,phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we identified ancient mitochondrial DNA (a total of 337 base pairs from the control region and cytochrome b) from eight northern Iberian lynx remains as Eurasian lynx. These results confirm the presence of Eurasian lynx in northern Iberia from the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary until just a few centuries ago. The paleontological record and our data indicate a population replacement of the Iberian lynx by the Eurasian lynx during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition in the Cantabrian cornice of Spain.

7290,,Beyond the snapshot: Landscape genetic analysis of time series data reveal responses of American black bears to landscape change,"Draheim, HM; Moore, JA; Fortin, MJ; Scribner, KT","Landscape genetic studies typically focus on the evolutionary processes that give rise to spatial patterns that are quantified at a single point in time. Although landscape change is widely recognized as a strong driver of microevolutionary processes, few landscape genetic studies have directly evaluated the change in spatial genetic structure (SGS) over time with concurrent changes in landscape pattern. We introduce a novel approach to analyze landscape genetic data through time. We demonstrate this approach using genotyped samples (n=569) from a large black bear (Ursus americanus) population in Michigan (USA) that were harvested during 3years (2002, 2006, and 2010). We identified areas that were consistently occupied over this 9-year period and quantified temporal variation in SGS. Then, we evaluated alternative hypotheses about effects of changes in landscape features (e.g., deforestation or crop conversion) on fine-scale SGS among years using spatial autoregressive modeling and model selection.

9189,,Floreana Island re-colonization potential of the Galápagos short-eared owl (Asio flammeus galapagoensis),"Schulwitz, S; Castano, PA; Mosquera, D; Chugcho, M; Campbell, KJ; Johnson, JA","Non-native invasive species threaten Galapagos' endemic biodiversity, and increasing efforts are underway to protect its species from further harm. One such project is focused on the eradication of invasive rodents using rodenticide bait on Floreana, the archipelago's sixth largest island. Short-eared owls (Asio flammeus galapagoensis) that consume poisoned rodents will, therefore, be at risk of secondary poisoning. If negatively impacted, it is not known to what degree the Floreana Island short-earned owl population is isolated, and whether potential re-colonization exists from its closest neighboring large population on Santa Cruz. Based on eight microsatellite loci and mtDNA control region sequence data from museum and contemporary samples, the short-eared owl populations on Floreana and Santa Cruz are not isolated from each other. However, gene flow is asymmetric from Floreana to Santa Cruz and not in the opposite direction. Morphometric data, including tarsus and bill size, and behavioral observations corroborate the genetic results and suggest that the Floreana population may possess unique traits compared to neighboring populations. For example, Floreana short-eared owls are more crepuscular than neighboring islands, which are predominately nocturnal, and were also non-responsive to inter-island call back recordings. Therefore, these results have important management implications concerning short-eared owl persistence on Floreana following rodenticide application. We recommend that managers implement additional precautions to protect the short-eared owl population until the risk of secondary poisoning has passed such as maintaining individuals in captivity. This study provides no evidence to suggest that short-eared owls are likely to disperse from Floreana's closest large population on Santa Cruz if the local population is negatively impacted by rodenticide exposure, and the observed morphological and behavioral traits argue against translocating owls between islands.",Schulwitz.Sarah@peregrinefund.org; jajohnson@unt.edu,2018,10.1007/s10592-017-1007-x,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,ACS,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"microsats, but also mtdna control region data",,,,,,,,,
10917,,Lack of spatial and temporal genetic structure of Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) populations,"Gong, XL; Davenport, ER; Wang, DH; Clark, AG","Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) is an important food source in East Asia whose population has dramatically declined since the 1970s. Despite past analysis with DNA sequencing, microsatellite and isozyme methods, management decisions remain hampered by contradictory findings. For example, it remains unresolved whether Japanese eels are a single panmictic population or whether they harbor significant substructure. Accurate assessment of population genetic substructure, both spatial and temporal, is essential for determining the relevant number of distinct management units appropriate for this species. In the present study, we assayed genetic variation genome-wide using Restriction Site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-seq) technology to analyze the population genetic structure of Japanese eels. For analysis of temporal isolation, five cohort samples were collected yearly from 2005 to 2009 in the Yangtze River Estuary. For analysis of spatial structure, five arrival wave samples were collected in China in 2009, and two arrival wave samples were collected in Japan in 2001. In each cohort of each arrival wave, five individuals were collected for a total of 55 eels sampled. In total, 214,210 loci were identified from these individuals, 106,652 of which satisfied quality checks and were retained for further analysis. There was relatively little population differentiation between arrival waves and cohorts collected either at different locations during the same year (F-st=0.077) or at the same location collected over subsequent years (F-st=0.082), and locations displayed no consistent isolation-by-distance.",ac347@cornell.edu,2019,10.1007/s10592-019-01146-8,CONSERVATION GENETICS,temporal-genetics,ACS,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,,other,Actinopterygii,"Japan,China","Chibaken.Kagawa,Yangtze River Estuary,Yangtze River Estuary,Guangdong province.Fujian,Zhejiang.Jiangsu,Guangdong province.Yangtze River Estuary,Yangtze River Estuary","2001.01.01,2005.02.01,2006.03.01,2009.01.01,2009.02.01,2009.03.01,2012.01.01,20014.01.01","5.5,5,5,5.5,5.5,5.5",1095 - 6205,pre-designed,natural,NA,,,chronic,SNP,fin,ethanol,phenol-chloroform,Illumina_HiSeq,RAD,No driver process; Generation Time (Age at maturity): Kotake et al. 2007,,,,,,,,,

Next-generation sequencing allows for thousands of genomic markers to be analyzed, which provides the resolution needed to address these questions in marine species with weakly differentiated populations. Greenland Halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) is one of the most important exploited demersal species throughout the North Atlantic, in particular in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. There, two nurseries are known, the St. Lawrence Estuary and the northern Anticosti Island, but their contribution to the renewal of stocks remains unknown. The goals of this study were (a) to document the genetic structure and (b) to estimate the contribution of the different identified breeding stocks to nurseries. We sampled 100 juveniles per nursery and 50 adults from seven sites ranging from Saguenay Fjord to offshore Newfoundland, with some sites sampled over two consecutive years in order to evaluate the temporal stability of the contribution. Our results show that after removing sex-linked markers, the Estuary/Gulf of St. Lawrence represents a single stock which is genetically distinct from the Atlantic around Newfoundland (F-ST = 0.00146, p-value = .001). Population assignment showed that recruitment in both nurseries is predominantly associated with the St. Lawrence stock. However, we found that the relative contribution of both stocks to the nurseries is temporally variable with 1% contribution of the Newfoundland stock one year but up to 33% for the second year, which may be caused by year-to-year variation in larval transport into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This study serves as a model for the identification of stocks for fisheries resources in a context where few barriers to dispersal occur, in addition to demonstrating the importance of considering sex-linked markers and temporal replicates in studies of population genomics.",emilie.carrier.10@ulaval.ca,2020,10.1111/eva.12979,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,temporal-genomics,BR,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,,marine,Actinopterygii,Canada,"ESTJ.ANTJ.SAGU.ESTU.GASP.NANT.ESQU.NFLD.NFLG,ESTJ.ANTJ.SAGU.ESTU.GASP.NANT.ESQU.NFLD.NFLG,","2016.01.01,2017.01.01","100.100.50.50.50.50.50.50.50,100.100.50.50.50.50.50.50.50",3215 - 4854.5,pre-designed,natural,NA,,,chronic,SNP,fin,ethanol,Aljanabi & Martinez 1997,Ion Protontm,RAD,No driver process; Generation time (Age at 50% maturity): Morgan and Bowering 2000,,,,,,,,,
3704,,Temporal variation in spatial genetic structure during population outbreaks: Distinguishing among different potential drivers of spatial synchrony,"Larroque, J; Legault, S; Johns, R; Lumley, L; Cusson, M; Renaut, S; Levesque, RC; James, PMA","Spatial synchrony is a common characteristic of spatio-temporal population dynamics across many taxa. While it is known that both dispersal and spatially autocorrelated environmental variation (i.e., the Moran effect) can synchronize populations, the relative contributions of each, and how they interact, are generally unknown. Distinguishing these mechanisms and their effects on synchrony can help us to better understand spatial population dynamics, design conservation and management strategies, and predict climate change impacts. Population genetic data can be used to tease apart these two processes as the spatio-temporal genetic patterns they create are expected to be different. A challenge, however, is that genetic data are often collected at a single point in time, which may introduce context-specific bias. Spatio-temporal sampling strategies can be used to reduce bias and to improve our characterization of the drivers of spatial synchrony. Using spatio-temporal analyses of genotypic data, our objective was to identify the relative support for these two mechanisms to the spatial synchrony in population dynamics of the irruptive forest insect pest, the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), in Quebec (Canada). AMOVA, cluster analysis, isolation by distance, and sPCA were used to characterize spatio-temporal genomic variation using 1,370 SBW larvae sampled over four years (2012-2015) and genotyped at 3,562 SNP loci. We found evidence of overall weak spatial genetic structure that decreased from 2012 to 2015 and a genetic diversity homogenization among the sites. We also found genetic evidence of a long-distance dispersal event over >140 km. These results indicate that dispersal is the key mechanism involved in driving population synchrony of the outbreak. Early intervention management strategies that aim to control source populations have the potential to be effective through limiting dispersal. However, the timing of such interventions relative to outbreak progression is likely to influence their probability of success.",larroque.jeremy@gmail.com,2019,10.1111/eva.12852,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,temporal-genetics,EG,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,,terrestrial,Insecta,Canada,"site1.site2.site3.site4.site5.site6.site7.site8.site9.site10.site11.site12.site13.site14.site15.site16.site17.site18.site19.site20.site21.site22.site23.site24.site25.site26.site27.site28.site29.site30,site10.site11.site13.site16.site17.site18.site23.site27.site28.site29.site31.site32.site35.site36,site10.site11.site12.site13.site16.site18.site23.site24.site26.site27.site29.site31.site33.site35.site36.site37.site38,site11.site14.site18.site24.site29.site31.site33.site34.site35.site36","2012.06.01,2013.06.01,2014.06.01,2015.06.01","25.24.16.21.21.8.17.12.24.22.23.19.25.25.10.24.24.24.10.15.25.25.7.9.9,25.24.28.31.27.31.18.29.28.33.32.16.32.32,9.16.15.12.15.17.11.14.12.12.12.10.14.14.15.15.10,19.14.19.19.15.15.13.14.12",365,opportunistic,natural,env_variation,invasive_species,,chronic,SNP,body,frozen,Qiagen DNA Blood and Tissue Kit,Illumina_HiSeq,RAD,Generation time: Royama 1984,,,,,,,,,
9581,,Inferring dispersal across a fragmented landscape using reconstructed families in the Glanville fritillary butterfly,"Fountain, T; Husby, A; Nonaka, E; Dileo, MF; Korhonen, JH; Rastas, P; Schulz, T; Saastamoinen, M; Hanski, I","Dispersal is important for determining both species ecological processes, such as population viability, and its evolutionary processes, like gene flow and local adaptation. Yet obtaining accurate estimates in the wild through direct observation can be challenging or even impossible, particularly over large spatial and temporal scales. Genotyping many individuals from wild populations can provide detailed inferences about dispersal. We therefore utilized genomewide marker data to estimate dispersal in the classic metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia L.), in the Aland Islands in SW Finland. This is an ideal system to test the effectiveness of this approach due to the wealth of information already available covering dispersal across small spatial and temporal scales, but lack of information at larger spatial and temporal scales. We sampled three larvae per larval family group from 3732 groups over a six-year period and genotyped for 272 SNPs across the genome. We used this empirical data set to reconstruct cases where full-sibs were detected in different local populations to infer female effective dispersal distance, that is, dispersal events directly contributing to gene flow. On average this was one kilometre, closely matching previous dispersal estimates made using direct observation. To evaluate our power to detect full-sib families, we performed forward simulations using an individual-based model constructed and parameterized for the Glanville fritillary metapopulation. Using these simulations, 100% of predicted full-sibs were correct and over 98% of all true full-sib pairs were detected. We therefore demonstrate that even in a highly dynamic system with a relatively small number of markers, we can accurately reconstruct full-sib families and for the first time make inferences on female effective dispersal. This highlights the utility of this approach in systems where it has previously been impossible to obtain accurate estimates of dispersal over both ecological and evolutionary scales.",toby.fountain@ebc.uu.se,2018,10.1111/eva.12552,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,temporal-genetics,EG,AAS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,,terrestrial,Insecta,Finland,"Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik,Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik,Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik,Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik,Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik,Sottunga.Foglo.Saltvik","2007.01.01,2008.01.01,2009.01.01,2010.01.01,2011.01.01,2012.01.01","114.259.495,37.80.187,49.63.835,21.22.456,34.99.2017,69.285.3200",365,pre-designed,natural,NA,,,NA,SNP,body,NA,NucleoSpin 96 Tissue Core Kit (Macherey-Nagel),KASP platform,RNA,"Generation time: Hanski et al., 2017; no real driver or sample storage",,,,,,,,,

We use statistical phylogeographic methods to create a mitochondria] DNA-based timetree for 118 squirrel monkey samples across 68 localities spanning all Amazonian centers of endemism, with the aim of better understanding (1) the effects of rivers as barriers to dispersal and distribution; (2) the area of origin for modern Saimiri; (3) whether ancestral Saimiri was a lowland lake-affiliated or an upland forest taxa; and (4) the effects of Pleistocene climate fluctuation on speciation. We also use our topology to help resolve current controversies in Saimiri taxonomy and species relationships. The Rondonia and Inambari centers in the southern Amazon were recovered as the most likely areas of origin for Saimiri. The Amazon River proved a strong barrier to dispersal, and squirrel monkey expansion and diversification was rapid, with all speciation events estimated to occur between 1.4 and 0.6 Ma, predating the last three glacial maxima and eliminating climate extremes as the main driver of squirrel monkey speciation. Saimiri expansion was concentrated first in central and western Amazonia, which according to the """"Young Amazon"""" hypothesis was just becoming available as floodplain habitat with the draining of the Amazon Lake. Squirrel monkeys also expanded and diversified east, both north and south of the Amazon, coincident with the formation of new rivers. This evolutionary history is most consistent with a Young Amazon Flooded Forest Taxa model, suggesting Saimiri has always maintained a lowland wetlands niche and was able to greatly expand its range with the transition from a lacustrine to a riverine system in Amazonia. Saimiri vanzolinii was recovered as the sister group to one clade of Saimiri ustus, discordant with the traditional Gothic vs. Roman morphological division of squirrel monkeys. We also found paraphyly within each of the currently recognized species: S. sciureus, S. ustus, and S. macrodon. We discuss evidence for taxonomic revision within the genus Saimiri, and the need for future work using nuclear markers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We use a molecular dataset assembled from vouchered samples with known localities throughout the country, as a reference for statistical phylogenetic, population genetic, and DNA barcoding analyses of genetic material obtained during a three year survey of the Manila pet trade. Our results provide the first genetic evaluation of a major Southeast Asian city's illegal trade in monitors and allow us to establish several important conclusions regarding actual, versus reported, origins of Manila's black market Varanus. Monitor lizards are clearly transported throughout the archipelago for trade; we identified genotypes from areas surrounding Manila, the distinct Bicol faunal subregion of Luzon, Mindanao Island, the Visayan islands, islands of the Romblon Province, the Babuyan islands, and Mindoro Island. Numerous species are involved, including multiple endemic Philippine taxa, the threatened Gray's monitor (Varanus olivaceus), and the presumably non-Philippine rough-neck monitor (Varanus rudicollis).

Based on morphological traits, this species has been subdivided into 12 subspecies. Thus far, there have been few molecular studies investigating intraspecific variation, and those had been limited in geographic scope. For this reason, we aimed to study the genetic structure and evolutionary history of this species across its very large distribution range in Asia. We employed both PCR-based (short mtDNA fragments, 94 samples) and high throughput sequencing based methods (whole mitochondrial genomes, 52 samples) on archival, noninvasively collected and fresh samples to investigate the distribution of intraspecific genetic variation. Our comprehensive sampling coupled with the improved resolution of a mitochondrial genome analyses provided strong support for a deep split between Mainland and Sundaic Leopard cats. Although we identified multiple haplogroups within the species' distribution, we found no matrilineal evidence for the distinction of 12 subspecies. In the context of Leopard cat biogeography, we cautiously recommend a revision of the Prionailurus bengalensis subspecific taxonomy: namely, a reduction to 4 subspecies (2 mainland and 2 Sundaic forms).",patel@izw-berlin.de,2017,10.1093/jhered/esx017,JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,historical-dna,JW,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using 1938 bp of mitochondrial DNA (cyt b gene, partial ND4 gene plus adjacent tRNA genes) from a nearly range-wide sampling, we examined its phylogeographic structure and compared our findings with previously published GenBank sequences. We identified seven major clades that are largely parapatrically distributed. A few records of distinct haplotypes at the same locality or in close proximity could be the result of translocation of tortoises by man. The greatest diversity occurs in the south of the species' range, with five out of the seven clades. Testing for isolation-by-distance suggests that the observed phylogeographic structure is the result of restricted geographical gene flow and not of historical vicariance. This is in sharp contrast to wide-ranging thermophilic reptiles from the western Palaearctic, whose phylogeographic structure was significantly shaped by Pleistocene range interruptions, but also by earlier dispersal and vicariant events. Most cyt b sequences of S. pardalis from GenBank turned out to be nuclear pseudogenes, or to be of chimerical origin from such pseudogenes and authentic mitochondrial sequences, which argues for caution regarding uncritical usage of GenBank sequences. The recent revalidation of the two subspecies of S. pardalis was based on such a chimerical sequence that was erroneously identified with the subspecies S. p. babcocki. Furthermore, according to our data, the distribution of mitochondrial clades does match neither the traditional subspecies ranges nor the pronounced geographical size variation of leopard tortoises.

Recent collections from Kenya allowed us to carry out population-level analyses for the diverse assemblage of East African Scotophilus. Multi-locus coalescent delimitation methods indicated strong support for three recently named lineages thought to be restricted to Kenya and Tanzania; it also uncovered two new distinctive lineages at present known only from Kenya. Subsequent taxonomic assessments that integrate these genetic data with phenotypic, distributional, and/or ecological traits are needed to establish these lineages as valid species.

6697,,Strong philopatry derived from capture–recapture records does not lead to fine-scale genetic differentiation in lesser kestrels,"Alcaide, M; Serrano, D; Tella, JL; Negro, JJ","The integration of capture-recapture and molecular approaches can improve our understanding of the consequences of habitat fragmentation on population connectivity. Here we employed microsatellites to test dispersal hypotheses derived from intense and long-term ringing programmes of the lesser kestrel Falco naumanni in Western Europe. Re-encounters of 1308 marked individuals in Spain have revealed that most first-time breeders settled within 10 km from their natal colony, with a negative association between dispersal and geographical distance. Although these findings would predict fine-scale spatial patterns of genetic differentiation, the genetic impact of rarely reported events concerning long-distance effective dispersal (> 100 km) is unknown. First, we investigated a spatially structured and geographically isolated population located in north-eastern Spain, where capture-recapture records and genetic data could be appropriately compared over similar spatial and temporal scales. Spatial autocorrelation analyses (N = 174 nestlings from different broods) did not reveal either significant differences in average relatedness at any distance class nor decreased relatedness as a function of distance. At a broader spatial scale, Bayesian analysis of population structure (N = 432 nestlings) indicated panmixia across Western Europe. However, F-ST comparisons between four geographically distinct populations indicated low but significant genetic differentiation. Our genetic data would therefore challenge traditional assumptions associating philopatry with the emergence of fine-scale genetic structuring. This could be because even low levels of gene flow are enough to preclude the development of local genetic structure. Nevertheless, the analysis of a geographically isolated and small population from Southern France exemplifies a situation in which restricted dispersal has translated into weak but consistently significant genetic differentiation. Relevant to conservation genetics and evolutionary biology, our results may lessen the genetic concerns derived from population fragmentation at relatively small geographical scales in species with apparently limited dispersal abilities, but raises concerns about increased genetic divergence in small and isolated demes.",malcaide@ebd.csic.es,2009,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01493.x,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,KC,AAS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We failed to detect any polymorphic sites in the ITS-2 region. We detected 59 COI haplotypes, among which two were shared by different species. While a haplotype network and a phylogenetic gene tree of the COI haplotypes did not support monophyly for any of the three species, the results of AMOVA did not invalidate the classification of these beetles into three species. The isolation-with-migration analytic (IMa) test suggested that gene flow between allopatric species (i.e., H. pustulosa versus H. niponica; H. pustulosa versus H. yasutomii) was well prevented, probably because of their limited dispersal power. On the other hand, the IMa test detected a low level of unidirectional gene flow between the sympatric species H. niponica and H. yasutomii, from the former to the latter. This result was consistent with a survival rate of F1 hybrids between the two species that is higher on the host plant of H. yasutomii than on the host plant of H. niponica. High F(ST) values among two sympatric and three nearly sympatric population pairs of H. niponica and H. yasutomii, however, indicated that gene flow between the two species has been quite restricted even if it has occurred. Because no reproductive barriers other than the difference in host plants is known for sympatric H. niponica and H. yasutomii, our results suggest that host differentiation and associated ecological divergence function as an effective reproductive barrier between the two species.Resume Genetique moleculaire des populations d'un complexe d'especes jumelles de coccinelles phytophages avec specificite d'hote (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae: Epilachninae) En vue d'eclaircir les relations phylogenetiques et de mesurer l'intensite et la persistence de l'isolement reproductif du a la specificite d'hote chez trois coccinelles phytophages (Henosepilachna pustulosa, H. niponica et H. yasutomii), nous avons determine d'une part, les sequences de la region ITS-2 (388 pb) de l'ADN nucleaire chez 70 individus dans 7 populations et d'autre part, d'une partie du gene mitochondrial cytochrome c oxydase sous unite I (COI; 985 pb) chez 280 individus provenant de 28 populations.

Le test analytique de migration-avec-isolement (IMa) a suggere que l'echange genique entre des especes allopatriques (H. pustulosa versus. H. niponica; H. pustulosa versus. H. yasutomii) est bien empeche, sans doute a cause de leur pouvoir de dispersion limite. Par ailleurs, le test IMa a detecte un flux genique unidirectionel faible entre les especes sympatriques H. niponica et H. yasutomii, du premier au second. Ce resultat est en accord avec le fait que le taux de survie des hybrides F1 entre ces deux especes est superieur sur la plante hote de H. yasutomii que sur celle de H. niponica. Cependant, des valeurs elevees de F(ST) pour deux paires de populations sympatriques et trois paires presque sympatriques de H. niponica et H. yasutomii ont montre des echanges de genes nuls ou tres restreints entre ces deux especes. Malgre l'absence de barriere reproductive autre que la difference de plantes hotes entre les populations sympatriques de H. niponica et H. yasutomii, nos resultats suggerent que la specificite d'hote et la divergence ecologique qui en resulte constituent une barriere reproductive efficace entre les deux especes.",nkoba@museum.hokudai.ac.jp; ayamo@t.vodafone.ne.jp; minegishi@t-kagaku.co.jp; koichiro-tamura@c.metro-u.ac.jp; aotsuka-tada-shi@c.metro-u.ac.jp; katakura@sci.hokudai.ac.jp,2011,10.1111/j.1439-0469.2010.00581.x,JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,historical-dna,KF,BR,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
939,,Spatial and temporal population genetic structure of four northeastern Pacific littorinid gastropods: the effect of mode of larval development on variation at one mitochondrial and two nuclear DNA markers,"Lee, HJE; Boulding, EG","We investigated the effect of development mode on the spatial and temporal population genetic structure of four littorinid gastropod species. Snails were collected from the same three sites on the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada in 1997 and again in 2007. DNA sequences were obtained for one mitochondrial gene, cytochrome b (Cyt b), and for up to two nuclear genes, heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) and aminopeptidase N intron (APN54). We found that the mean level of genetic diversity and long-term effective population sizes (N-e) were significantly greater for two species, Littorina scutulata and L. plena, that had a planktotrophic larval stage than for two species, Littorina sitkana and L. subrotundata, that laid benthic egg masses which hatched directly into crawl-away juveniles. Predictably, two poorly dispersing species, L. sitkana and L. subrotundata, showed significant spatial genetic structure at an 11- to 65-km geographical scale that was not observed in the two planktotrophic species. Conversely, the two planktotrophic species had more temporal genetic structure over a 10-year interval than did the two direct-developing species and showed highly significant temporal structure for spatially pooled samples. The greater temporal genetic variation of the two planktotrophic species may have been caused by their high fecundity, high larval dispersal, and low but spatially correlated early survivorship.

7779,,Seasonal and cyclical changes in genetic composition of the marine intertidal rock pool copepod Tigriopus brevicornis,"Van Wormhoudt, A","Tigriopus brevicornis is a marine rock pool copepod widely distributed along Atlantic coasts. Due to the absence of a known dispersal mechanism by free swimming stages, exchanges between populations over long distances are questionable. In order to analyse the evolution of an isolated supralittoral rock pool population, sampling of the copepod was performed monthly during 1 year and compared to samplings over 5 years in the same rock pool, as well as from other rock pools. Using ITS1 analysis, cyclical changes in genetic composition were detected. Our results give clear indications concerning the segregation of the rock pool population and a lack of gene flow among outside populations. A network analysis shows the presence of several shared dominant haplotypes and also singletons differing by one mutation point. F-st analyses indicate that the main changes occur in autumn and winter. The few analogies of ITS1 sequences with nearby populations may indicate that new migrants must re-colonise the pools from surrounding rock crevices in the intertidal habitat where they may have found a refuge after bad weather conditions.",avw@mnhn.fr,2015,10.1007/s10528-015-9674-0,BIOCHEMICAL GENETICS,historical-dna,KF,BR,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,no,marine,Hexanauplia,France,ConcarneauMarineStation,"2010.12.15,2007.10.24,2007.09.24,2007.08.20,2007.07.19,2007.06.20,2007.05.22,2007.04.27,2007.03.15,2007.02.14,2007.01.20,2006.12.14,2006.11.15,2005.12.14","23,15,18,20,18,20,20,19,20,19,15,15,19,29",25,pre-designed,natural,NA,,,NA,nuclear_seq,muscle,ethanol,Picopure extraction kit,Sanger,PCR,"Many copepods (1000s) were extracted for each time but they were extracted together, cloned into a vector, and clones were sequenced - sample #s given are for clones.

Although the otter was historically present along the coast in Oregon, there are currently no populations in this region and reintroduction efforts have failed. We examined the mtDNA genotypes of 16 pre-harvest otter samples from two Oregon locations in an attempt to determine the best genotypic match with extant populations. Our amplifications of a 222 base-pair portion of the control region from otters ranging in age from approximately 175-2000 years revealed four genotypes. The genotypic composition of pre-harvest otter populations appears to match best with those of contemporary populations from California and not from Alaska, where reintroduction stocks are typically derived.",niles@pdx.edu,2008,10.1007/s10592-007-9422-z,CONSERVATION GENETICS,ancient-dna,KF,BR,reject,ancient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8966,,Spatial and temporal genetic variation among size classes of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) provides information on oceanic dispersal and population dynamics,"Jensen, MP; Bell, I; Limpus, CJ; Hamann, M; Ambar, S; Whap, T; David, C; FitzSimmons, NN","Migratory marine species present challenges for conservation because of complex threats within their pelagic dispersal zones, including coastal foraging areas and extensive migration pathways, or at breeding grounds. To better understand the connectivity between green turtle rookeries and foraging populations, we sequenced the mtDNA control region of 987 turtles from 6 major foraging grounds on a similar to 2300 km longitudinal transect off eastern Australia, and used mixed stock analysis (MSA) to estimate their natal origins. We investigated variation in natal origins within different size classes and over spatial and temporal scales and compared this to approximately 30 yr of mark-recapture data. For adult turtles, we found that the northern Great Barrier Reef (nGBR) genetic stock dominated in the northern feeding grounds while the southern Great Barrier Reef (sGBR) and Coral Sea stocks dominated in the south, with a changeover of dominating stock occurring between 14 degrees and 20 degrees S. However, at the 3 most northern feeding grounds, we found an unexpected decrease (17-30%) in the proportion of nGBR turtles among small immature turtles relative to large immatures and adults. Four possible hypotheses were explored, with the 2 most plausible being that (1) small immature turtles from the sGBR and other rookeries first settle in nGBR feeding grounds, but later shift to other feeding grounds as they mature, or (2) a reduced hatching success for decades from the main nGBR rookery at Raine Island has resulted in reduced recruitment into the nGBR feeding ground from this stock.

Previous studies on dispersal patterns of orangutans, largely non-gregarious Asian great apes, have yielded conflicting results. Based on 7 years of observational data and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA analyses on fecal samples of 41 adult Bornean orangutans () from the Tuanan population, we provide both genetic and behavioral evidence for male dispersal and female philopatry. Although maternally related adult female dyads showed similar home-range overlap as unrelated dyads, females spent much more time in association with known maternal relatives than with other females. While in association, offspring of maternally related females frequently engaged in social play, whereas mothers actively prevented this during encounters with unrelated mothers, suggesting that unrelated females may pose a threat to infants. Having trustworthy neighbors may therefore be a social benefit of philopatry that may be common among solitary mammals, thus reinforcing female philopatric tendencies in such species. The results also illustrate the diversity in dispersal patterns found within the great-ape lineage.",vnoord@aim.uzh.ch,2012,10.1007/s00265-012-1330-7,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,museum-dna,KF,BR,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Populations of both currently recognized subspecies are highly fragmented and critically small in Asia. We used DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the mitochondrial control region to estimate the degree of mitochondrial differentiation and rates of female gene flow between the subspecies. We obtained genetic samples from 51 individuals of Otis tarda dybowskii representing multiple populations, including the first samples from Kazakhstan and Mongolia and samples from near the Altai Mountains, the proposed geographic divide between the subspecies, allowing for better characterization of the boundary between the 2 subspecies. We compared these with existing sequence data (n = 66) from Otis tarda tarda. Our results suggest, though do not conclusively prove, that O. t. dybowskii and O. t. tarda may be distinct species. The geographic distribution of haplotypes, phylogenetic analysis, analyses of molecular variance, and coalescent estimation of divergence time and female migration rates indicate that O. t. tarda and O. t. dybowskii are highly differentiated in the mitochondrial genome, have been isolated for approximately 1.4 million years, and exchange much less than 1 female migrant per generation. Our findings indicate that the 2 forms should at least be recognized and managed as separate evolutionary units.

578,,"Non-native carp of the genus Cyprinus in Lake Xingyun, China, as revealed by morphology and mitochondrial DNA analysis","Yang, B; Chen, XY; Yang, JX","Lake Xingyun is a major body of water in Yunnan Province, China. Previous investigations suggested that the lake contained native populations of carp of the genus Cyprinus, but it is believed that these native populations disappeared due to overfishing. However, one or more Cyprinus species are currently abundant in Lake Xingyun but their identity and origin are unclear. To determine if the existing Cyprinus population is indeed non-native, we compared the morphologies of fish (n = 62) recently captured (2007) to museum preserved Cyprinus collected in the lake in the 1960s. In addition, we conducted mitochondrial DNA analyses of Cyprinus (n = 65) recently taken from the lake and found 28 haplotypes. The genetics of the lake's sample were compared to Cyprinus from a wide range of other locations within and outside China. Together with previously published Japanese and Eurasian haplotypes, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated 28 haplotypes and these were classified into five different units. One of the five units included 16 closely related haplotypes that formed a monophyletic group apart from the Eurasian clade. Given their monophyly that included 3 native carp haplotypes, haplotypes from this unit were thought to originate from the native strain of Lake Xingyun. Furthermore, combining this with result from morphological analysis, it was concluded that these haplotypes were likely hybrid carp. Conversely, haplotypes from the other 4 units nested into the Eurasian clade. Their phylogenetic affinities to Eurasian lineages indicated that these haplotypes were domesticated strains introduced from other parts of China, Vietnam and Europe. These conclusions were supported by historical records on introduction. This study revealed that almost all carp from current Lake Xingyun may be originated from hybrid strains and domesticated strains introduced from Eurasia.",chenxy@mail.kiz.ac.cn; yangjx@mail.kiz.ac.cn,2011,10.1007/s10530-010-9793-9,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,historical-dna,RC,BR,reject,species_identification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conservation status of this critically endangered tree snail radiation is of considerable import, but is clouded by taxonomic uncertainty due to the extensive lack of congruence among species designations, diagnostic morphologies, and molecular markers. Using a combination of museum, captive, and remnant wild snails, we obtained the first high-resolution nuclear genomic perspective of the evolutionary relationships and survival of fourteen Windward Island Partula species, totaling 93 specimens. We analyzed similar to 1,607-28,194 nuclear genomic loci collected with the double digest restriction-site associated sequencing method. Results from phylogenomic trees, species estimation, and population assignment tests yielded monophyly of the Windward Island subgroup. Within this group, two well-supported clades encompassing five species complexes were recovered. Clade 1 was restricted to Tahiti and contained two species complexes: """"P. affinis"""" (three species) and """"P. otaheitana"""" (five species). Clade 2 occurred on Moorea and on Tahiti and consisted of three species complexes: one Tahitian, """"P. clara/P. hyalina""""; the other two, """"P. taeniata"""" (three species) and """"P. suturalis"""" (six species), Moorean. Our genomic results largely corroborated previous mitochondrial DNA survival estimates for Moorea and Tahiti, with all five species complexes having members surviving in captivity and/or as remnant wild populations, although the details vary in each case.

2081,,Genomic data recover previously undetectable fragmentation effects in an endangered amphibian,"McCartney-Melstad, E; Vu, JK; Shaffer, HB","A critical consideration when using molecular ecological methods to detect trends and parameterize models at very fine spatial and temporal scales has always been the technical limits of resolution. Key landscape features, including most anthropogenic modifications, can cause biologically important, but very recent changes in gene flow that require substantial statistical power to detect. The problem is one of temporal scale: Human change is rapid and recent, while genetic changes accumulate slowly. We generated SNPs from thousands of nuclear loci to characterize the population structure of New York-endangered eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) on Long Island and quantify the impacts of roads on population fragmentation. In stark contrast to a recent microsatellite study, we uncovered highly structured populations over an extremely small spatial scale (approximately 40 km(2)) in an increasingly human-modified landscape. Geographic distance and the presence of roads between ponds were both strong predictors of genetic divergence, suggesting that both natural and anthropogenic factors contribute to the observed patterns of genetic variation. All ponds supported small to modest effective breeding populations, and pond surface area showed a strong positive correlation with population size. None of these patterns emerged in an earlier study of the same system using microsatellite loci, and we determined that at least 300-400 SNPs were needed to recover the fine-scale population structure present in this system. Conservation assessments using earlier genetic techniques in other species may similarly lack the statistical power for small-scale inferences and benefit from reassessments using genomic tools.",evanmelstad@ucla.edu,2018,10.1111/mec.14892,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,RC,BR,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2963,,"A modified stepping-stone model of populatoin structure in red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus (Sciaenidae), from the northern Gulf of Mexico","Gold, JR; Burridge, CP; Turner, TF","Genetic studies of population or 'stock' structure in exploited marine fishes typically are designed to determine whether geographic boundaries useful for conservation and management planning are identifiable. Implicit in many such studies is the notion that subpopulations or stocks, if they exist, have fixed territories with little or no gene exchange between them. Herein, we review our long-term genetic studies of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), an estuarine-dependent sciaenid fish in the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean. Significant differences in frequencies of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and of alleles at nuclear-encoded microsatellites occur among red drum sampled across the northern Gulf of Mexico. The spatial distribution of the genetic variation, however, follows a pattern of isolation-by-distance consistent with the hypothesis that gene flow occurs among subpopulations and is an inverse (and continuous) function of geographic distance. However, successful reproduction and recruitment of red drum depend on estuarine habitats that have geographically discrete boundaries. We hypothesize that population structure in red drum follows a modified one-dimensional, linear stepping-stone model where gene exchange occurs primarily (but not exclusively) between adjacent bays and estuaries distributed linearly along the coastline. Gene flow does occur among estuaries that are not adjacent but probabilities of gene exchange decrease as a function of geographic distance. Implications of our hypothesis are discussed in terms of inferences drawn from patterns of isolation-by-distance and relative to conservation and management of estuarine-dependent species like red drum. Based on estimates of the ratio of genetic effective population size and census size in red drum, observed patterns of gene flow in red drum may play a significant role in recruitment.",goldfish@tamu.edu,2001,10.1023/A:1013705230346,GENETICA,museum-dna,RC,BR,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,no,marine,Actinopterygii,United States,"TampaBay.ApalachicolaBay.BiloxiBay.GrandIsle.WestBay.PassCavallo.LagunaMadre,TampaBay.ApalachicolaBay.BiloxiBay.GrandIsle.WestBay.PassCavallo.LagunaMadre,TampaBay.ApalachicolaBay.BiloxiBay.GrandIsle.WestBay.PassCavallo.LagunaMadre,TampaBay.ApalachicolaBay.BiloxiBay.GrandIsle.WestBay.PassCavallo.LagunaMadre","1989.01.01,1988.01.01,1987.01.01,1986.01.01","39.42.27.27.20.29.50,44.46.19.31.29.30.58,42.37.36.47.29.18.19,24.24.94.43.32.13.18",950,pre-designed,anthropogenic,human_exploitation,,,chronic,microsat,muscle,frozen,not specified,Sanger,PCR,"Sample sizes from Gold and Turner 2002 (microsats).

Micropopulation processes, such as gene flow, operating within geographic regions are often poorly understood, despite their potential to affect stock structure and sustainability. This is especially true for highly mobile species, such as elasmobranchs, where the potential for spatial overlap of regional populations is increased as a result of greater movement capabilities. A lack of information on these processes means that management plans rarely consider spatio-temporal structure. 2. Spurdog (Squalus acanthias) are globally distributed throughout temperate regions yet there is an apparent lack of gene flow between ocean basins. In the North-east Atlantic there is little work on gene flow within the region, which is currently managed as a single stock that is estimated to be at 19% compared with 1905. Some evidence from this region suggests population processes that have the potential to cause structuring. 3. The population structure of the North-east Atlantic spurdog was investigated using an 828-bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region and seven focal polymorphic microsatellite markers. Samples from 295 individuals from eight locations throughout UK waters were used in this study. 4. Overall, mitochondrial sequences suggest some regional differentiation. Genetic diversity was comparable with that reported in previous studies of spurdog. Haplotype diversity (0.782-1.000) is amongst the highest observed for an elasmobranch. Microsatellite markers suggest that a high level of relatedness was responsible for regional population structuring. There was no apparent spatial structure after removal of ` full sibling' relationships. 5. Inter-haul variation from Celtic Sea samples is suggestive of subpopulations and aggregation events, which may have important implications for fisheries conservation of this and other elasmobranch species.",jat21@st-andrews.ac.uk; c.s.jones@abdn.ac.uk,2018,10.1002/aqc.2922,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,temporal-genetics,AAS,ACS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,no,marine,Chondrichthys,Ireland,Celtic Sea,"2011.09.21, 2011.08.21, 2010.12.12, 2010.10.03","15, 137, 19, 18",3178-5734 (fishbase),opportunistic,natural,env_variation,,,chronic,microsat,fin,ethanol,phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,,,,,,,,,,

6635,,The final frontier: early-stage genetic introgression and hybrid habitat use in the northwestern extent of the Golden-winged Warbler breeding range,"Moulton, LL; Vallender, R; Artuso, C; Koper, N","Anthropogenic changes to the landscape and climate have resulted in secondary contact between previously allopatric species. This can result in genetic introgression and reverse speciation when closely related species are able to hybridize. The Golden-winged Warbler has declined or been extirpated across much of its range where it has come into secondary contact with the Blue-winged Warbler. Genetic screening previously showed that introgression had occurred range-wide with the exception of Manitoba, Canada. Our goal was to reassess the genetic status of the Golden-winged Warbler population in Manitoba and to examine the demographics and habitat use of phenotypic and genetic hybrids. From 2011 to 2014, we sampled and screened mtDNA from 205 Golden-winged Warblers and hybrids in southeast Manitoba. In 2012, we monitored all Golden-winged Warbler territories within those sites and measured territory- and landscape-level habitat variables. Of the birds screened, 195 had a phenotype that matched their mtDNA type, two were phenotypic hybrids, and eight showed a phenotypic-mtDNA mismatch (cryptic hybrids). We found no difference in the habitat used by Golden-winged Warblers compared with hybrids at either scale. The low proportion of hybrids found in Manitoba and the lack of a distinguishable difference in habitat use by Golden-winged Warblers and hybrids indicates that the exclusion of hybrid birds from Golden-winged Warbler habitat is unlikely to be a successful conservation strategy. The best way to manage for Golden-winged Warblers is to slow the habitat loss and fragmentation that continues within Manitoba and to actively manage early-successional deciduous forest using tools such as fire and logging.",laurel.moulton@gmail.com,2017,10.1007/s10592-017-0989-8,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,RC,ACS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,yes,terrestrial,Aves,Canada,Manitoba,"2014.01.01, 2013.01.01, 2012.01.01, 2011.01.01","45, 66, 66, 28",365,pre-designed,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,feather.toepad,NA,(Ivanova et al. 2006),NA,NA,introgression study w/temp data; generation time estimated from age of sexual maturity: https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Vermivora_chrysoptera/,,,,,,,,,

We examined the landscape genetic structure of the endangered Point Arena mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa nigra), whose isolated geographic range is found in a restricted (85 km(2)) but heterogenous region in California. Based on its diminutive range we may predict widespread gene flow and a relatively weak role for landscape variation in defining genetic structure. We used skin, bone, tissue and noninvasively collected hair samples to describe genetic substructure and model gene flow. We examined spatial partitioning of multilocus DNA genotypes and mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. We identified 3 groups from microsatellite data, all of which had low estimates of effective population size consistent with significant tests for historical bottlenecks. We used least-cost-path analysis with the microsatellites to examine how vegetation type affects gene flow in a landscape genetics framework.

9074,,Non-indigenous introgression into the Norwegian red deer population,"Haanes, H; Rosvold, J; Roed, KH","Rates of introgression from non-indigenous into native populations are increasing worldwide, often as a result of anthropogenic translocation events. In ungulates translocations have been common, especially among deer. European red deer consists of two distinct lineages, one western and one eastern. These probably originate from different glacial refuges, but it is unknown to what extent they hold different adaptations. Here we address dispersal and introgression into the Norwegian mainland population from an introduced island stock consisting of an admixture of both European lineages. The last decade this stock has grown considerably in number and dispersal could be expected to have increased. We therefore used samples separated by a 5 year interval from Otteroya, adjacent mainland areas and a more distant sub-population. Bayesian assignment analysis verified the genetic structure and identified dispersal between the Otteroya stock and the adjacent mainland coastal areas. Three individuals (two newly sampled) with second or third generation non-indigenous origin were found among the adjacent mainland samples (5 and 3 %, respectively). Two individuals with first and second generation mainland-origin were found on Otteroya (old samples).

Significant heterogeneity in microsatellite allele distributions was detected among all localities except between the two in the Atlantic. Significant heterogeneity in mtDNA haplotypes was not detected, a result likely due to extremely low mtDNA diversity. The genetic discontinuities combined with seasonal movement patterns, a patchy distribution of appropriate nursery habitat, the apparent absence of sex-biased gene flow, and the occurrence of mating in the vicinity of nursery areas, suggest that both male and female finetooth sharks display regional philopatry to discrete nursery areas. Global and local tests of neutrality, using mtDNA haplotypes, and demographic model testing, using Approximate Bayesian Computation of microsatellite alleles, supported a range-wide expansion of finetooth sharks into US waters occurring less than similar to 9000 years ago. These findings add to the growing number of studies in a variety of coastally distributed marine fishes documenting significant barriers to gene flow around peninsular Florida and in the eastern Gulf.

While Indian tiger numbers have somewhat stabilized in recent years, they remain low and populations are highly fragmented. Therefore, the application of evidence-based demographic and genetic management to enhance the remaining populations is a priority. In this context, and using genetic data from historical and modern tigers, we investigated anthropogenic impacts on genetic variation in Indian tigers using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers. We found a very high number of historical mitochondrial DNA variants, 93 per cent of which are not detected in modern populations. Population differentiation was higher in modern tigers. Simulations incorporating historical data support population decline, and suggest high population structure in extant populations. Decreased connectivity and habitat loss as a result of ongoing fragmentation in the Indian subcontinent has therefore resulted in a loss of genetic variants and increased genetic differentiation among tiger populations. These results highlight that anthropogenic fragmentation and species-specific demographic processes can interact to alter the partitioning of genetic variation over very short time scales. We conclude that ongoing strategies to maximize the size of some tiger populations, at the expense of losing others, is an inadequate conservation strategy, as it could result in a loss of genetic diversity that may be of adaptive significance for this emblematic species.",uramakri@ncbs.res.in,2013,10.1098/rspb.2013.0496,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,historical-dna,ACS,ACS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,popsize,,no,terrestrial,Mammalia,India,NA,"2010.01.01-2008.01.01, 1975.01.01-1836.01.01","63, 53",1096-1461,opportunistic,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,human_exploitation,,chronic,microsat,tissue.feces.bones,dried,Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies examine this temporal and spatial variation over large portions of a species' geographic range or between cryptic species that overlap in their range. Despite the potential for long-distance dispersal in blue rockfish Sebastes mystinus, a previous study of adults revealed two geographically distinct, cryptic species. To determine year-to-year variation in the patterns of spatial connectivity and to elucidate the potential ecological mechanisms involved in shaping new year-classes and maintaining cryptic species, we sampled juveniles within California, USA, where both cryptic species coexist. Using microsatellite markers, we found geographic and temporal variation in the number of individuals from these distinct cryptic species within 2 new year-classes of juvenile S. mystinus. We also found differences in the geographic patterns of genetic structure of the 2 cryptic species. Whereas one species exhibited little or no spatial genetic structure across the study region, the other exhibited a complex geographic pattern of genetic structure, with little or no genetic structure among regions, but small-scale structure within a region. The results of this study demonstrate that the spatial scales and patterns of realized dispersal of pelagic larvae vary geographically, interannually, and between closely related species with similar life-history strategies.

Genetic material sequenced from ancient samples is revolutionizing our understanding of the recent evolutionary past. However, ancient DNA is often degraded, resulting in low coverage, error-prone sequencing. Several solutions exist to this problem, ranging from simple approach, such as selecting a read at random for each site, to more complicated approaches involving genotype likelihoods. In this work, we present a novel method for assessing the relationship of an ancient sample with a modern population, while accounting for sequencing error and postmortem damage by analyzing raw reads from multiple ancient individuals simultaneously. We show that, when analyzing SNP data, it is better to sequence more ancient samples to low coverage: two samples sequenced to 0.5x coverage provide better resolution than a single sample sequenced to 2x coverage. We also examined the power to detect whether an ancient sample is directly ancestral to a modern population, finding that, with even a few high coverage individuals, even ancient samples that are very slightly diverged from the modern population can be detected with ease. When we applied our approach to European samples, we found that no ancient samples represent direct ancestors of modern Europeans. We also found that, as shown previously, the most ancient Europeans appear to have had the smallest effective population sizes, indicating a role for agriculture in modern population growth.",joshua.schraiber@temple.edu,2018,10.1534/genetics.117.300448,GENETICS,adna,RC,ACS,reject,ancient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"aDNA & human, but may contain useful information for study design",,,,,,,,,

We investigated the invasion of Lord Howe Island by the delicate skink Lampropholis delicata and assessed the introduction history and genetic structure of this species over a 5-year period. Using genetic data taken from 2007, and again in 2011/12, we examined changes in the population genetic structure (whether new haplotypes had been introduced to the island, and shifts in haplotype frequencies) of the species on the island between these two time points. No new haplotypes were introduced to the island between 2007 and 2011/12; however, significant shifts in haplotype frequencies across the island were detected. We conclude that the delicate skink is expanding its range into the southern regions of the island and that the haplotype frequencies on Lord Howe Island are still in a state of highly dynamic flux. Our study highlights the importance of considering invasions as dynamic and studying them in such a way that enable us to better manage their impacts.",David.Chapple@monash.edu,2015,10.1093/czoolo/61.3.456,CURRENT ZOOLOGY,temporal-genetics,RC,ACS,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,no,terrestrial,Reptilia,Australia,Lord Howe Island,"2012.01.01-2011.01.01, 2007.01.01"," 225, 140",NA,pre-designed,anthropogenic,invasive_species,,,acute,mtDNA_seq,tail,NA,Qiagen,Sanger,PCR,,,,,,,,,,
10568,,Near-shore distribution of phyllosomas of the two only lobster species (Decapoda: Achelata) present in Robinson Crusoe Island and endemic to the Juan Fernandez archipelago,"Palma, AT; Caceres-Montenegro, I; Bennett, RS; Magnolfi, S; Henriquez, LA; Guerra, JF; Manriquez, K; Palma, RE","Two lobster species coexist in the southeast Pacific Juan Fernandez archipelago, Jasus frontalis (Milne-Edwards, 1837) and Acantharctus delfini (Bouvier, 1909). Like most lobster species they undergo a prolonged larval period, which is particularly long for J. frontalis (> 16 months). Though typical of Palinurids, this long larval duration is usually not thought to be conducive to local recruitment. While it is known that settlement is confined to the three islands of the archipelago (Robinson Crusoe, Alejandro Selkirk and Santa Clara) and Desventuradas Islands (aprox. 800 km to the north), it remains poorly understood how local larval supply allows such distribution pattern. The goal of this study is twofold. Firstly, we aimed to characterize the distribution and abundance of the larvae of these two species around Robinson Crusoe Island using plankton tows and systematic hydrographic records between October 2008 to March of 2011, thus providing the first systematic and prolonged coupled biophysical observations in the nearshore of the archipelago. We hypothesize that spatial and temporal larval distribution patterns are associated to their retention around the archipelago, thus contributing to our knowledge of the physical and biological processes maintaining their extreme isolation. Secondly, using molecular genetics, we confirm a simple taxonomic criteria to distinguish the larvae of the two species, thus aiding future studies of larval dynamics. Throughout phyllosomas of A. delfini were more abundant than that of J. frontalis. Both species were more abundant on the northern shores of Robinson Crusoe Island and generally associated with warmer and saltier waters and mostly present in the samples collected during spring and summer months. Phyllosomas of both species were more abundant during night-time tows in the upper layer of the water column surveyed suggesting a diurnal vertical migration behavior which, for coastal dwelling meroplanktonic species, can be related to a nearshore larval retention mechanism. These preliminary results represent a pioneering effort to understand the mechanisms driving the endemism and extreme isolation of the two study species.",apalma@bio.puc.cl,2011,10.4067/S0716-078X2011000300006,REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,temporal-genetics,RC,ACS,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA-based techniques can expand the utility of these collections to explore their demographic and evolutionary history, temporal changes in their abundance, and pathogen dynamics. Using museum collections of the non-model bee species Eucera (Peponapis) pruinosa Say 1837 (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Eucerini), we developed a standard minimally-destructive and budget-friendly protocol to extract DNA and amplify common gene-fragments for barcoding, phylogenetic analysis, and pathogens. We also generated genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) libraries for population structure analyses. We systematically studied the effect of specimen age (<= 10 years ago) and tissue type (whole bees vs. abdomen) on DNA quality, single gene-fragment amplification, and SNP calling. We found that all analyses were achievable with both tissue types, yet with variable levels of efficiency because of general DNA degradation. Specifically, we found that not all samples yielded satisfactory results for molecular studies; however, we did not find a systematic effect of specimen age on DNA quality which is encouraging for future studies involving historical specimens. We report the first evidence for the presence of the microsporidian pathogen Nosema spp. in squash bees, opening a window for the study of historical changes in disease pressure in this important agricultural pollinator.

However, characterizing mechanisms that contribute to heterogeneity, such as migration and dispersal, is required before site fidelity and migratory connectivity can be assessed accurately. We studied nonbreeding groups of Common Mergansers (Mergus merganser) molting on Kodiak Island, Alaska, from 2005 to 2007, using banding data to assess rates of recapture, mitochondrial (mt) DNA to determine natal area, and nuclear microsatellite genotypes to assess dispersal. Using baseline information from differentiated mtDNA haplogroups across North America, we were able to assign individuals to natal regions and document: population genetic heterogeneity within and among molting groups. Band-recovery and DNA data suggest that both migration from and dispersal among natal areas contribute to admixed groups of males molting on Kodiak Island. A lack of differentiation in the Common Merganser's nuclear, bi-parentally inherited DNA, observed across North America, implies that dispersal can mislead genetic assessments of migratory connectivity and assignments of nonbreeding individuals to breeding areas. Thus multiple and independent data types are required to account for such behaviors before accurate assessments of migratory connectivity can be made.",jpearce@usgs.gov,2009,10.1525/cond.2009.080043,CONDOR,museum-dna,ACS,KJ,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is due to the lack of wild, known-locality specimens for genetic studies. In this genetic study, we include four known-locality specimens of M. annamensis-two historical specimens (the lectotype and paralectotype of the junior synonym Annamemys merkleni), a living zoo specimen that was collected in 1966, and a contemporary, wild-caught specimen captured during intensive field surveys. We have three major findings regarding the genetics of M. annamensis and closely related species. First, with wild specimens from near the type locality, we identify mitochondrial and nuclear haplotypes for true M. annamensis. Second, we verify that M. guangxiensis is invalid due to its non-monophyly. Lastly, we verify that M. mutica from Anhui Province and Taiwan cluster genetically with samples from the type locality in Zhejiang Province. Despite these new data from known-locality specimens providing guidance for ex situ and in situ conservation efforts, some of the genetic patterns for M. annamensis and M. mutica defy obvious explanation and highlight the need for even more samples with reliable known provenance.",jonfong@ln.edu.hk,2019,10.5358/hsj.38.140,CURRENT HERPETOLOGY,historical-dna,RC,KJ,reject,species_identification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11099,,Evaluatin hybridization capture with RAD probes as a tool for museum genomics with historical bird specimens,"Linck, EB; Hanna, ZR; Sellas, A; Dumbacher, JP","Laboratory techniques for high-throughput sequencing have enhanced our ability to generate DNA sequence data from millions of natural history specimens collected prior to the molecular era, but remain poorly tested at shallower evolutionary time scales. Hybridization capture using restriction site-associated DNA probes (hyRAD) is a recently developed method for population genomics with museum specimens. The hyRAD method employs fragments produced in a restriction site-associated double digestion as the basis for probes that capture orthologous loci in samples of interest. While promising in that it does not require a reference genome, hyRAD has yet to be applied across study systems in independent laboratories. Here, we provide an independent assessment of the effectiveness of hyRAD on both fresh avian tissue and dried tissue from museum specimens up to 140 years old and investigate how variable quantities of input DNA affect sequencing, assembly, and population genetic inference. We present a modified bench protocol and bioinformatics pipeline, including three steps for detection and removal of microbial and mitochondrial DNA contaminants. We confirm that hyRAD is an effective tool for sampling thousands of orthologous SNPs from historic museum specimens to describe phylogeographic patterns. We find that modern DNA performs significantly better than historical DNA better during sequencing but that assembly performance is largely equivalent. We also find that the quantity of input DNA predicts %GC content of assembled contiguous sequences, suggesting PCR bias.

2212,,Stabilization of a salamander moving hybrid zone,"Visser, M; de Leeuw, M; Zuiderwijk, A; Arntzen, JW","When related species meet upon postglacial range expansion, hybrid zones are frequently formed. Theory predicts that such zones may move over the landscape until equilibrium conditions are reached. One hybrid zone observed to be moving in historical times (1950-1979) is that of the pond-breeding salamanders Triturus cristatus and Triturus marmoratus in western France. We identified the ecological correlates of the species hybrid zone as elevation, forestation, and hedgerows favoring the more terrestrial T. marmoratus and pond density favoring the more aquatic T. cristatus. The past movement of the zone of ca. 30 km over three decades has probably been driven by the drastic postwar reduction of the """"bocage"""" hedgerow landscape, favoring T. cristatus over T. marmoratus. No further hybrid zone movement was observed from 1979 to the present. To explain the changing dynamics of the hybrid zone, we propose that it stalled, either because an equilibrium was found at an altitude of ca. 140 m a.s.l. or due to pond loss and decreased population densities. While we cannot rule out the former explanation, we found support for the latter. Under agricultural intensification, ponds in the study area are lost at an unprecedented rate of 5.5% per year, so that remaining Triturus populations are increasingly isolated, hampering dispersal and further hybrid zone movement.",pim.arntzen@naturalis.nl,2017,10.1002/ece3.2676,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,historical-dna,AAS,KJ,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10229,,"Entomological time travel: reconstructing the invasion history of the buckeye butterflies (genus Junonia) from Florida, USA","Lalonde, MML; Marcus, JM","Invasion biology examines the process by which non-native species integrate into new habitats. Three species of buckeye butterflies (genus Junonia) currently occur in Florida, USA, including Junonia coenia (polyphagous and widely distributed), J. neildi (monophagous and restricted to coastal areas), and J. zonalis (polyphagous tropical species restricted to frost-free South Florida). Two species have long been resident in Florida, whereas J. zonalis was first detected in Florida in 1981. Diagnostic morphological and molecular markers exist for determining Junonia with Caribbean ancestry, allowing observation of the invasion and creation of a secondary contact zone over space and time. We developed techniques to quickly, inexpensively, and unambiguously determine mitochondrial genotypes from museum specimens collected in Florida and the Caribbean over the last 150years. We reconstructed the invasion of J. zonalis as it colonized Florida using 816 Junonia museum specimens from 1866 to 2016, including some of the oldest insect museum specimens ever genotyped. Significant correlations were found between the presence of Caribbean genotypes and latitude, longitude, and time. Junonia zonalis likely colonized Florida from Cuba by the 1930s, followed by hybridization with resident species, with ongoing genetic exchange between Cuba and the Florida Keys. Episodic gene flow between Florida Keys and mainland populations of J. zonalis may also be occurring. Mainland mitochondrial genotypes appear to be more resilient to extreme high and low temperatures than Caribbean genotypes. This time series in Junonia can be used as a model for understanding the process of adaptation required for successful invasion of new habitats.",Melanie.m.l.lalonde@gmail.com; marcus@cc.umanitoba.ca,2019,10.1007/s10530-019-01948-4,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,ancient-dna,EG,KJ,reject,non-genomic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tough but they didn't sequence anything.

5848,,Complexity related to behavior of stability in mdoeled coastal zone ecosystems,"Wang, SL; Rohwer, S; Delmore, K; Irwin, DE","Hybrid zones are particularly valuable for understanding the evolution of partial reproductive isolation between differentiated populations. An increasing number of hybrid zones have been inferred to move over time, but in most such cases zone movement has not been tested with long-term genomic data. The hybrid zone between Townsend's Warblers (Setophaga townsendi) and Hermit Warblers (S. occidentalis) in the Washington Cascades was previously inferred to be moving from northern S. townsendi southwards towards S. occidentalis, based on plumage and behavioural patterns as well as a 2000-km genetic wake of hermit mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in coastal Townsend's Warblers. We directly tested whether hybrid zone position has changed over 2-3 decades by tracking plumage, mtDNA and nuclear genomic variation across the hybrid zone over two sampling periods (1987-94 and 2015-16). Surprisingly, there was no significant movement in genomic or plumage cline centres between the two time periods. Plumage cline widths were narrower than expected by neutral diffusion, consistent with a 'tension zone' model, in which selection against hybrids is balanced by movement of parental forms into the zone. Our results indicate that this hybrid zone is either stable in its location or moving at a rate that is not detectable over 2-3 decades. Despite considerable gene flow, the stable clines in multiple phenotypic and genotypic characters over decades suggest evolutionary stability of this young pair of sister species, allowing divergence to continue. We propose a novel biogeographic scenario to explain these patterns: rather than the hybrid zone having moved thousands of kilometres to its current position, inland Townsend's met coastal Hermit Warbler populations along a broad front of the British Columbia and Alaska coast and hybridization led to replacement of the Hermit Warbler plumage with Townsend's Warbler plumage patterns along this coastline. Hence, hybrid zones along British Columbia and Alaska moved only a short distance from the inland to the coast, whereas the Hermit Warbler phenotype appears stable in Washington and further south. This case provides an example of the complex biogeographic processes that have led to the distribution of current phenotypes within and among closely related species.",wangsmt@zoology.ubc.ca,2019,10.1111/jeb.13524,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,museum-dna,AAS,KJ,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,yes,terrestrial,Aves,"United States,Canada",Cascade Mountain Range,NA,NA,657,opportunistic,natural,NA,,,chronic,SNP,scale,dried,phenol-chloroform,Illumina_HiSeq,GBS,"contempo specimens were blood stored in etoh; no driver, testing for change in a hybrid zone over time; also used mtDNA seq",,,,,,,,,

Compilation of collection data from bays and estuaries of the Pacific North American coast show many new localities have been colonized in the last two decades, moving outward from harbors and bays with high commercial traffic into smaller coastal locations dominated by local recreational traffic. DNA barcode sequence data for G. japonica reveals two distinct clades: one found in San Francisco Bay and sites to the north, and one also found in San Francisco Bay and sites to the south. The two clades differ by an average 7.28 % genetic distance, large enough to consider these invasive amphipods two separate species. Both northern and southern clades exhibit low levels of genetic diversity, suggesting a single introduction event for each.

Their ages and relative abundance suggest that additional hybrids and conceivably purebred C. abingdoni individuals still occur on Volcano Wolf.

We used genetic data to identify population clusters and quantify gene flow over historical and contemporary time frames in the Diamondback Terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin). This species has a long and complicated history with humans, including commercial overharvesting and subsequent translocation events during the early twentieth century. Today, terrapins face threats from habitat loss and mortality in fisheries bycatch. To evaluate population structure and gene flow among Diamondback Terrapin populations in the Chesapeake Bay region, we sampled 617 individuals from 15 localities and screened individuals at 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Our goals were to demarcate metapopulation structure, quantify genetic diversity, estimate effective population sizes, and document temporal changes in gene flow. We found that terrapins in the Chesapeake Bay region harbour high levels of genetic diversity and form four populations. Effective population sizes were variable. Among most population comparisons, estimates of historical and contemporary terrapin gene flow were generally low (m approximate to 0.01). However, we detected a substantial increase in contemporary gene flow into Chesapeake Bay from populations outside the bay, as well as between two populations within Chesapeake Bay, possibly as a consequence of translocations during the early twentieth century. Our study shows that inferences across multiple time scales are needed to evaluate population connectivity, especially as recent changes may identify threats to population persistence.",paulconverse@icloud.com,2015,10.1111/mec.13440,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,JW,KJ,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3975,,Age-related parental care in a long-lived bird: implications for offspring development,"Ball, L; Shreves, K; Pilot, M; Moura, AE","Social structure plays a crucial role in determining a species' dispersal patterns and genetic structure. Cetaceans show a diversity of social and mating systems, but their effects on dispersal and genetic structure are not well known, in part because of technical difficulties in obtaining robust observational data. Here, we combine genetic profiling and GIS analysis to identify patterns of kin distribution over time and space, to infer mating structure and dispersal patterns in short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). This species is highly social, and exhibits weak spatial genetic structure in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, thought to result from fluid social structure and low levels of site fidelity. We found that although sampled groups were not composed of closely related individuals, close kin were frequently found in the same geographic location over several years. Our results suggest that common dolphin exhibits some level of site fidelity, which could be explained by foraging for temporally varying prey resource in areas familiar to individuals. Dispersal from natal area likely involves long-distance movements of females, as males are found more frequently than females in the same locations as their close kin. Long-distance dispersal may explain the near panmixia observed in this species. By analysing individuals sampled in the same geographic location over multiple years, we avoid caveats associated with divergence-based methods of inferring sex-biased dispersal. We thus provide a unique perspective on this species' social structure and dispersal behaviour, and how it relates to the observed low levels of population genetic structure in European waters. Significance statement Movement patterns and social interactions are aspects of wild animal's behaviour important for understanding their ecology. However, tracking these behaviours directly can be very challenging in wide-ranging species such as whales and dolphins. In this study, we used genetic information to detect how patterns of kin associations change in space and time, to infer aspects of movement and social structure. We identified previously unknown site fidelity, and suggested that dispersal usually involves females, travelling long distances from the natal area. Our data analysis strategy overcomes known limitations of previously used genetic inference methods, and provides a new approach to identify differences in dispersal between the sexes, which contribute to better understanding of the species' behaviour and ecology. In this case, we suggest that females are more likely to disperse than males, a pattern unusual amongst mammals.",amoura@lincoln.ac.uk,2017,10.1007/s00265-017-2351-z,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,temporal-genetics,JW,KJ,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the phylogenetic relationships among seven of the eight described species in Central America were inferred based on mitochondrial DNA sequences from 103 individuals, including decades-old museum samples and two likely extinct species, plus ten South American species. Among Central American samples, we discovered two candidate species that should be incorporated into conservation programs. Phylogenetic inference revealed a ladderized topology, placing species geographically furthest from South America more nested in the tree. Model-based ancestral area estimation supported either one or two colonization events from South America. Relaxed-clock analysis of divergence times indicated thatAtelopuscolonized Central America prior to 4 million years ago (Ma), supporting a slightly older than traditional date for the closure of the Isthmus.

DNA sequence variation of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was analysed in 367 individuals sampled from nine populations across the Indo-West Pacific. Hierarchical AMOVA indicated strong genetic structuring amongst populations (FST?=?0.372, P?<?0.001); however, sequence divergence between the 47 haplotypes detected was low (maximum 1.8% difference) and no deep phylogenetic divergence was observed. Results suggest the presence of genetic barriers isolating populations of the South China Sea and central Indonesian regions, which, in turn, show patterns of historical separation from northern Australian regions. In P.?maxima, historical vicariance during Pleistocene low sea levels is likely to have restricted planktonic larval transport, causing genetic differentiation amongst populations. However, low genetic differentiation is observed where strong ocean currents are present and is most likely due to contemporary larval transport along these pathways. Geographical association with haplotype distributions may indicate signs of early lineage sorting arising from historical population separations, yet an absence of divergent phylogenetic clades related to geography could be the consequence of periodic pulses of high genetic exchange. We compare our results with previous microsatellite DNA analysis of these P.?maxima populations, and discuss implications for future conservation management of this species.

This moth invaded during the last 20-30 years the North American continent, threatening the major center of biodiversity of native Opuntia species. Although human induced and natural dispersal have been invocated to explain its expansion in the non-native distribution range, there is still no evidence to support natural dispersal. In particular, hurricanes are one of the major environmental factors affecting species dispersal in the region. In this study we used mitochondrial DNA to examine whether the spatial distribution of haplotype variation of C. cactorum is at least partially explained by hurricane trajectories within the Caribbean region. DNA sequences for the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I were obtained for a sample of 110 individuals from the Antillean islands. This information was combined with existing sequences in the GenBank for the same gene for the Caribbean and Florida (N = 132 sequences). Genetic diversity descriptors, a haplotypic network, a spatial analyses of molecular variance and a landscape genetic analysis of migration conditioned by hurricane tracks were conducted to test our hypothesis. Our results revealed a significant spatial grouping of haplotypes consistent with the more frequent hurricane trajectories in the Caribbean region. Significant isolation by distance conditioned by hurricane tracks was detected. Populations of Florida were genetically closer to those of Cuba than to the rest of the population sampled. Within the region, Cuba appears as a reservoir of genetic diversity increasing the risk of invasion to Mexico and the US. Despite commercial transportation of Opuntia promoted dispersal to Florida, our results support the hypothesis that natural disturbances such as hurricanes played a role dispersing this invasive insect.

Sars 1856), the northern krill, is the largest and most abundant euphausiid species in the northern hemisphere, where it represents a key component of many pelagic communities. Although planktonic, krill could be considered a nektonic organism, as it is capable of active movements. This behaviour may be adaptive, because it allows these organisms to maintain their geographic position, leading to stable population structure, despite being continuously exposed to the heterogeneous oceanic conditions.

Here we investigate the species diversity, phylogenetic relationships and phylogeographical patterns of giant clams in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and the Red Sea to explore scenarios of marine speciation in this under-studied region. Location Mozambique Channel, Madagascar, and the Mascarene Islands (WIO); the Farasan Islands (Red Sea). Taxon Giant clams of the genus Tridacna (Cardiidae: Tridacninae). Methods Giant clams were sampled as complete organisms or through underwater biopsies. Nuclear (28S) and mitochondrial (16S and COI) DNA sequences were subjected to Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses to generate a phylogenetic hypothesis for all known species within the genus Tridacna. Bayesian inference with molecular and fossil calibration was used to infer their colonization history. Results From the 10 genetically distinct clades recovered from the analyses of 253 sequenced specimens, five distinct Tridacna lineages were sampled, three of which were endemics of the WIO and the Red Sea. Each lineage corresponded to a distinct species, except one grouping the two formerly known WIO endemics, T. lorenzi and T. rosewateri. This lineage clustered with two other well-supported lineages: the Red Sea endemic T. squamosina, and a previously unrecognized lineage, restricted to the WIO, for which we resurrect the long-forgotten name T. elongatissima Bianconi, 1856. For the two other species sampled (T. maxima and T. squamosa), contrasting phylogeographical patterns were observed. Main conclusions Our data confirm the validity of the species T. rosewateri, a WIO endemic genetically indistinguishable from T. lorenzi, which should be considered a junior synonym. The phylogenetic placement of the newly resurrected T. elongatissima provides insights into the probable origin of T. squamosina, which split from its sister species no later than 2 Ma, likely during Middle Pleistocene glacial periods. Two scenarios are discussed. Our results also suggest that T. maxima invaded the Red Sea more recently and that contemporary gene flow between Red Sea and WIO T. maxima is highly restricted. The deep Red Sea partition observed in T. squamosa suggests a much older divergence and raises the question of a possible cryptic lineage.",cecile.fauvelot@ird.fr,2020,10.1111/jbi.13797,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,historical-dna,JW,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Includes connectivity but might focus too much on phylogenetics; RC: no temporal replicates,,,,,,,,,

For R. norvegicus, mtDNA analyses suggest at least four invasions distinct in space and/or time have occurred to establish its distribution in the U.S. Microsatellite analyses suggest for R. rattus that dispersal is characterized by an isolation-by-distance pattern, suggesting a relatively low frequency of long distance dispersal, and low levels of establishment for novel propagules. In contrast, microsatellite analyses of R. norvegicus suggest high frequencies of long distance dispersal and essentially panmixia among nearly all sampled populations, as well as a high frequency of novel propagules entering at the east and west coasts and assimilating into established populations. We discuss these results in the context of invasive Rattus management in the U.S. and their implications for invasive species in general, as well as the implications for managing the spread of rat-borne pathogens.",justin.lack@okstate.edu,2013,10.1007/s10530-012-0351-5,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,museum-dna,JW,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: uses museum samples but no temporal replicates,,,,,,,,,

Yet, rare cross-watershed transfers can also occur, whether mediated by (often historical) geological events or (often contemporary) human activities. We explored these events and their potential evolutionary consequences by analyzing patterns of neutral genetic variation (microsatellites) and adaptive phenotypic variation (male color) in wild guppies (Poecilia reticulata) distributed across two watersheds in northern Trinidad. We found the expected signatures of within-watershed gene flow; yet we also inferred at least two instances of cross-watershed gene flowone in the upstream reaches and one further downstream. The upstream cross-watershed event appears to be very recent (41 +/- 13years), suggesting dispersal via recent flooding or undocumented human-mediated transport. The downstream cross-watershed event appears to be considerably older (577 +/- 265years), suggesting a role for rare geological or climatological events. Alongside these strong signatures of both contemporary and historical gene flow, we found little evidence of impacts on presumably adaptive phenotypic differentiation, except perhaps in the one instance of very recent cross-watershed gene flow.

122,,Temporal recruitment patterns and gene flow in kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens),"Gilbert-Horvath, EA; Larson, RJ; Garza, JC","Pelagic dispersal of marine organisms provides abundant opportunity for gene flow and presumably inhibits population genetic divergence. However, ephemeral, fine-scale, temporal and spatial genetic heterogeneity is frequently observed in settled propagules of marine species that otherwise exhibit broad-scale genetic homogeneity. A large variance in reproductive success is one explanation for this phenomenon. Here, genetic analyses of 16 microsatellite loci are used to examine temporal patterns of variation in young-of-year kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens) recruiting to nearshore habitat in Monterey Bay, California, USA. Population structure of adults from central California is also evaluated to determine if spatial structure exists and might potentially contribute to recruitment patterns. Genetic homogeneity was found among 414 young-of-year sampled throughout the entire 1998 recruitment season. No substantial adult population structure was found among seven populations spanning 800 km of coastline that includes the Point Conception marine biogeographic boundary. Comparison of young-of-year and adult samples revealed no genetic differentiation and no measurable reduction in genetic variation of offspring, indicating little variance in reproductive success and no reduction in effective population size for this year class. Simulation analyses determined that the data set was sufficiently powerful to detect both slight population structure among adults and a small reduction in effective number of breeders contributing to this year class.

6419,,Temporally stable genetic variability and dynamic kinship structure in a fluctuating population of the root vole Microtus oeconomus,"Pilot, M; Dabrowski, MJ; Jancewicz, E; Schtickzelle, N; Gliwicz, J","Genetic variability, kin structure and demography of a population are mutually dependent. Population genetic theory predicts that under demographically stable conditions, neutral genetic variability reaches equilibrium between gene flow and drift. However, density fluctuations and non-random mating, resulting e.g. from kin clustering, may lead to changes in genetic composition over time. Theoretical models also predict that changes in kin structure may affect aggression level and recruitment, leading to density fluctuations. These predictions have been rarely tested in natural populations. The aim of this study was to analyse changes in genetic variability and kin structure in a local population of the root vole (Microtus oeconomus) that underwent a fourfold change in mean density over a 6-year period. Intensive live-trapping resulted in sampling 88% of individuals present in the study area, as estimated from mark-recapture data. Based on 642 individual genotypes at 20 microsatellite loci, we compared genetic variability and kin structure of this population between consecutive years. We found that immigration was negatively correlated with density, while the number of kin groups was positively correlated with density. This is consistent with theoretical predictions that changes in kin structure play an important role in population fluctuations. Despite the changes in density and kin structure, there was no genetic differentiation between years. Population-level genetic diversity measures did not significantly vary in time and remained relatively high (H-E range: 0.72-0.78).

2929,,Genetic and phenotypic characterization of a hybrid zone between polyandrous Northern and Wattled Jacanas in Western Panama,"Miller, MJ; Lipshutz, SE; Smith, NG; Bermingham, E","Background: Hybridization provides a unique perspective into the ecological, genetic and behavioral context of speciation. Hybridization is common in birds, but has not yet been reported among bird species with a simultaneously polyandrous mating system; a mating system where a single female defends a harem of males who provide nearly all parental care. Unlike simple polyandry, polyandrous mating is extremely rare in birds, with only 1% of bird species employing this mating system. Although it is classically held that females are """"choosy"""" in avian hybrid systems, nearly-exclusive male parental care raises the possibility that female selection against heterospecific matings might be reduced compared to birds with other mating systems. Results: We describe a narrow hybrid zone in southwestern Panama between two polyandrous freshwater waders: Northern Jacana, Jacana spinosa and Wattled Jacana, J. jacana. We document coincident cline centers for three phenotypic traits, mtDNA, and one of two autosomal introns. Cline widths for these six markers varied from seven to 142 km, with mtDNA being the narrowest, and five of the six markers having widths less than 100 km. Cline tails were asymmetrical, with greater introgression of J. jacana traits extending westward into the range of J. spinosa. Likewise, within the hybrid zone, the average hybrid index of phenotypic hybrids was significantly biased towards J. spinosa. Species distribution models indicate that the hybrid zone is located at the edge of a roughly 100 km wide overlap where habitat is predicted to be suitable for both species, with more westerly areas suitable only for spinosa and eastward habitats suitable only for J. jacana. Conclusion: The two species of New World jacanas maintain a narrow, and persistent hybrid zone in western Panama. The hybrid zone may be maintained by the behavioral dominance of J. spinosa counterbalanced by unsuitable habitat for J. spinosa east of the contact zone. Although the two parental species are relatively young, mitochondrial cline width was extremely narrow. This result suggests strong selection against maternally-inherited markers, which may indicate either mitonuclear incompatibilities and/or female choice against heterospecific matings typical of avian hybrid systems, despite jacana sex role reversal.",millerma@si.edu,2014,10.1186/s12862-014-0227-7,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,museum-dna,BR,RC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RC: uses museum samples but no temporal replicates,,,,,,,,,

Many studies have shown that insect species respond rapidly to climatic change. A mountain pine beetle epidemic of record size in North America has led to unprecedented mortality of lodgepole pine, and a significant range expansion to the northeast of its historic range. Our goal was to determine the spatial genetic variation found among outbreak population from which genetic structure, and dispersal patterns may be inferred. Beetles from 49 sampling locations throughout the outbreak area in western Canada were analysed at 13 microsatellite loci. We found significant north-south population structure as evidenced by: (i) Bayesian-based analyses, (ii) north-south genetic relationships and diversity gradients; and (iii) a lack of isolation-by-distance in the northernmost cluster. The north-south structure is proposed to have arisen from the processes of postglacial colonization as well as recent climate-driven changes in population dynamics. Our data support the hypothesis of multiple sources of origin for the outbreak and point to the need for population specific information to improve our understanding and management of outbreaks. The recent range expansion across the Rocky Mountains into the jack/lodgepole hybrid and pure jack pine zones of northern Alberta is consistent with a northern British Columbia origin. We detected no loss of genetic variability in these populations, indicating that the evolutionary potential of mountain pine beetle to adapt has not been reduced by founder events.

We aimed thereby to provide new insights into population structure to improve fisheries and biodiversity management in Irish freshwaters. LocationIreland, Britain and continental Europe. MethodsA total of 752 pike (Esox lucius) were sampled from 15 locations around Ireland, and 9 continental European sites, and genotyped at six polymorphic microsatellite loci. Patterns and mechanisms of population genetic structure were assessed through a diverse array of methods, including Bayesian clustering, hierarchical analysis of molecular variance, and approximate Bayesian computation. ResultsVarying levels of genetic diversity and a high degree of population genetic differentiation were detected. Clear substructure within Ireland was identified, with two main groups being evident. One of the Irish populations showed high similarity with British populations. The other, more widespread, Irish strain did not group with any European population examined. Approximate Bayesian computation suggested that this widespread Irish strain is older, and may have colonized Ireland independently of humans. Main conclusionsPopulation genetic substructure in Irish pike is high and comparable to the levels observed elsewhere in Europe. A comparison of evolutionary scenarios upholds the possibility that pike may have colonized Ireland in two waves', the first of which, being independent of human colonization, would represent the first evidence for natural colonization of a non-anadromous freshwater fish to the island of Ireland.

Biotas in freshwater wetlands and floodplains, such as those in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB)-one of Australia's most impacted ecosystems, are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic fragmentation. Here we present a comprehensive multilocus assessment of genetic variation in the threatened southern pygmy perch Nannoperca australis (578 individuals; 45 localities; microsatellite, allozyme and mitochondrial DNA datasets), an ecological specialist with low dispersal potential. We assess patterns of spatial structure and genetic diversity in populations spanning the highly fragmented MDB and test whether recent anthropogenic modification has disrupted range-wide connectivity. We detected strong and hierarchical population structure, very low genetic diversity and lack of contemporary gene flow across the MDB. In contrast, the apparent absence of pronounced or long-term phylogeographic structure suggests that observed population divergences generally do not reflect deeply historic natural fragmentation. Coalescent-based analyses supported this inference, revealing that divergence times between populations from the upper and lower MDB fall into the period of European settlement. It appears that the observed contemporary isolation of populations is partly explained by the severe modification of the MDB post-dating the onset of European settlement. Our integrated approach substantially improves the interpretation of how fragmentation impacts present-day biodiversity.

Levels of genetic variation were low for the remaining species, including the reef-forming Solenosmila variablis and Madrepora oculata, and more sensitive molecular markers may be needed to resolve their spatial structure properly. For two species (the scleractinian Stephanocyathus spiniger and the antipatharian Stichopathes filiformis), we found no evidence of genetic subdivision among sites within regions, suggesting sufficient gene flow occurs to maintain genetic homogeneity at scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers.

1058,,From regionally predictable to locally complex population structure in a freshwater top predator: river systems are not always the unit of connectivity in Northern Pike Esox lucius,"Bekkevold, D; Jacobsen, L; Hemmer-Hansen, J; Berg, S; Skov, C","Contemporary genetic diversity is the product of both historical and contemporary forces, such as climatic and geological processes affecting range distribution and continuously moulded by evolutionary forces selection, gene flow and genetic drift. Predatory freshwater fishes, such as Northern Pike Esox lucius, commonly exhibit small population sizes, and several local populations are considered endangered. Pike inhabit diverse habitat types, including lakes, rivers and brackish marine waters, thus spanning from small isolated patches to large open marine systems. However, pike population structure from local to regional scales is relatively poorly described, in spite of its significance to developing conservation measures. We analysed microsatellite variation in a total of 1185 North European pike from 46 samples collected across both local and regional scales, as well as over time, to address two overarching questions: Is pike population structure associated with local and/or regional connectivity patterns, and which factors likely have the main influence on the contemporary distribution of genetic diversity? To answer this, we combined estimators of population diversity and structure to assess evidence of whether populations within (i) habitats, (ii) drainage systems and (iii) geographical regions are closer related than among these ranges, and whether patterns are temporally stable. Contrasting previous predictions that genetic drift obscures signals of postglacial colonisation history, we identified clear regional differences in population genetic signatures, suggesting a major effect of drainage divides on colonisation history and connectivity.

We used nine microsatellite loci and recently developed methods in landscape genetics and coalescence-based estimation of historical gene flow and effective population sizes to assess temporal and spatial dynamics of the population structure in European flounder (Platichthys flesus L.). We collected 1062 flounders from 13 localities in the northeast Atlantic and Baltic Seas and found temporally stable and highly significant genetic differentiation among samples covering a large part of the species' range (global F-ST = 0.024, P < 0.0001). In addition to historical processes, a number of contemporary acting evolutionary mechanisms were associated with genetic structuring. Physical forces, such as oceanographic and bathymetric barriers, were most likely related with the extreme isolation of the island population at the Faroe Islands. A sharp genetic break was associated with a change in life history from pelagic to benthic spawners in the Baltic Sea. Partial Mantel tests showed that geographical distance per se was not related with genetic structuring among Atlantic and western Baltic Sea samples. Alternative factors, such as dispersal potential and/or environmental gradients, could be important for generating genetic divergence in this region.

The aim of this study is to investigate population connectivity of P. argus at two levels: (1) spatially between two marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Caribbean coast of Mexico, and (2) temporally within MPAs; by genotyping discrete size classes lobsters using microsatellite markers. No evidence of population differentiation between lobster populations from Banco Chinchorro and Sian Ka'an MPAs was found (P= 0.139). In contrast significant levels of population differentiation among discrete size classes of lobsters was found (F-ST = 0.0054; P=0.0052). Temporal variation among the genotypes of new larval recruits may explain these results.

5882,,Admixture of two phylogeographic lineages of the Eurasian beaver in Poland,"Biedrzycka, A; Konior, M; Babik, W; Swislocka, M; Ratkiewicz, M","The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) represents an uncommon example of an endangered species in which the restoration programs proved a spectacular success and led to enormous spatial and demographic expansion. Documented reintroduction of beavers in Poland has been conducted using animals of the eastern European origin, most likely derived from the eastern mtDNA lineage. However demographic and spatial expansion of beavers from Germany, which represent the western lineage, may have led to admixture of these two genetically distinct entities in Poland. We detected significant genetic differentiation between the populations from W and NE Poland both in mitochondrial DNA control region and microsatellites, but also substantial admixture including apparent first-generation migrants between regions. Our results indicate that beavers from the western mtDNA lineage have contributed considerably to the Polish population, particularly in W Poland. As there have been no adequately documented translocations of beavers from the western European populations to Poland, the observed situation appears to result from natural migration or range expansion from the west. In contrast to previous findings we detected a substantial diversity in mtDNA control region, which indicates that either the variation in relict populations has been underestimated, or that additional relict beaver populations survived at the end of the 19th century in Poland and Germany as indicated by considerable similarity of ancient and extant mtDNA haplotypes. The implications of our findings for beaver conservation and management are discussed. (C) 2014 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

6608,,Spatio-temporal Genetic Structure of a Tropical Bee Species Suggests High Dispersal Over a Fragmented Landscape,"Suni, SS; Bronstein, JL; Brosi, BJ","Habitat destruction threatens biodiversity by reducing the amount of available resources and connectivity among geographic areas. For organisms living in fragmented habitats, population persistence may depend on dispersal, which maintains gene flow among fragments and can prevent inbreeding within them. It is centrally important to understand patterns of dispersal for bees living in fragmented areas given the importance of pollination systems and recently documented declines in bee populations. We used population and landscape genetic techniques to characterize patterns of dispersal over a large fragmented area in southern Costa Rica for the orchid bee species Euglossa championi. First, we estimated levels of genetic differentiation among forest fragments as (PT), an analog to the traditional summary statistic F-ST, as well as two statistics that may more adequately represent levels of differentiation, G'(ST) and D-est. Second, we used a Bayesian approach to determine the number and composition of genetic groups in our sample. Third we investigated how genetic differentiation changes with distance. Fourth, we determined the extent to which deforested areas restrict dispersal. Finally, we estimated the extent to which there were temporal differences in allele frequencies within the same forest fragments. Within years we found low levels of differentiation even over 80km, and no effect of land use type on level of genetic differentiation. However, we found significant genetic differentiation between years. Taken together our results suggest that there are high levels of gene flow over this geographic area, and that individuals show low site fidelity over time.",sssuni@eco.umass.edu,2014,10.1111/btp.12084,BIOTROPICA,temporal-genetics,RC,KC,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,terrestrial,Insecta,Costa Rica,"Las Alturas,LC Station,Romero II,Osa,Las Alturas,LC Station,Romero II","2009,2009,2009,2010,2010,2010,2010","11,25,19,59,17,8,12",61,pre-designed,anthropogenic,habitat_loss,,,chronic,microsat,NA,NA,phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,"would qualify but uses microsats, generation time from  https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.543",,,,,,,,,
11000,,The Genetic Signature of Range Expansion in a Disease Vector-The Black-Legged Tick,"Leo, SST; Gonzalez, A; Millien, V","Monitoring and predicting the spread of emerging infectious diseases requires that we understand the mechanisms of range expansion by its vectors. Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping 10 microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from 8 different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones. Given that Lyme disease infection risk in a region can be influenced by the relative presence of established and/or adventitious tick populations, our results are useful for understanding both the seasonality and spatial variation of Lyme disease.",sarah.leo@mail.mcgill.ca,2017,10.1093/jhered/esw073,JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,temporal-genetics,RC,KC,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,terrestrial,Insecta,Canada,"BMF,DV,HR,HV,LP,LS,MSB,NO,SdV,SE,SF,SJ,SV,BMF,DV,HR,HV,LP,LS,MSB,NO,SdV,SE,SF,SJ,SV,BMF,DV,HR,HV,LP,LS,MSB,NO,SdV,SE,SF,SJ,SV,BMF,DV,HR,HV,LP,LS,MSB,NO,SdV,SE,SF,SJ,SV","2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2011,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2013,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014,2014","30,5,24,30,11,25,39,20,14,8,23,5,35,0,16,5,0,0,0,7,8,0,0,0,0,0,32,42,12,30,0,0,20,38,0,7,12,7,24,0,20,1,0,0,0,15,8,0,9,19,2,5",730,pre-designed,natural,invasive_species,,,chronic,microsat,body,NA,phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,generation time estimated from https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Ixodes_scapularis/,,,,,,,,,

These dynamic biological processes require monitoring with temporal environmental and landscape genetic data. We compared the spatial genetic variation of a relict, umbrella species, the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), in two different demographic periods, as represented by older museum specimens (1960-1990) and recent non-invasive samples (2011-2015) collected from the Carpathian Mountains, where habitat connectivity has dramatically decreased in the past decade. Using a combination of species distribution modelling and spatial genetic inference, we analysed how climatic and environmental constraints shaped population structures of the species. Environmental and climate niche models confirmed that relict Carpathian capercaillie populations are temperature sensitive, and they occur in a narrow range of mountain forest habitats at the highest altitudes. We found that the environmental and climatic constraints led to genetically isolated populations, but we also detected clusters that did not match relatively interrupted areas of niche habitats. We observed a similar disruption of gene flow in both periods; however, a stronger signal of genetic structuring in recent samples indicated that the processes negatively affecting connectivity are ongoing. The effective population size of the Carpathian population has declined in recent years, but it has been low for at least the last five decades in the Western Carpathians.

91,,Genetic diversification and demographic history of the cactophilic pseudoscorpion Dinocheirus arizonensis from the Sonoran Desert,"Pfeiler, E; Bitler, BG; Castrezana, S; Matzkin, LM; Markow, TA","Sequence data from a segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene were used to examine phylogenetic relationships, estimate gene flow and infer demographic history of the cactophilic chernetid pseudoscorpion, Dinocheirus arizonensis (Banks), from the Sonoran Desert. Phylogenetic trees resolved two clades of D. arizonensis, one from mainland Sonora, Mexico and southern Arizona (clade I) and the other from the Baja California peninsula and southern Arizona (clade II). The two clades were separated by a mean genetic distance (d) of similar to 2.6%. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance indicated highly significant population structuring in D. arizonensis (overall Phi(ST) = 0.860: P < 0.0001), with 80% of the genetic variation distributed among the two clades. Most pairwise comparisons of Phi(ST) among populations within each clade, however, were not significant. The results suggest that phoretic dispersal on vagile cactophilic insects such as the neriid cactus fly Odontoloxozus longicornis (Coquillett) provides sufficient gene flow to offset the accumulation of unique haplotypes within each clade of the non-vagile pseudoscorpion. Preliminary results on dispersal capability of O. longicornis were consistent with this conclusion. Tests designed to reconstruct demographic history from sequence data indicated that both clades of D. arizonensis, as well as O. longicornis, have experienced historical population expansions. Potential barriers to gene flow that may have led to genetic isolation and diversification in clades I and II of D. arizonensis are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In autumns of poor hard mast years, although females used sites far from their primary home ranges, they returned to sites near their primary range before den entry. In habitats, where good denning habitat is spatially close to the spring and summer range, maternal communities may range throughout the area during the denning, spring, and summer seasons.

Cultural inheritance of migration routes represents a mechanism whereby geographical isolation can arise between separate groups and could constrain individuals to potentially suboptimal sites within their range. Conversely, adopting the parental migratory route in adult life, rather than dispersing randomly, may increase an individual's reproductive success because that strategy has already been proven to allow successful breeding. We combined a pedigree of related light-bellied Brent geese (Branta bernicla hrota) with 6 years of observations of marked birds to calculate the dispersal distances of adult offspring from their parents in both Ireland and Iceland. In both countries, the majority of offspring were found to recruit into or near their parental sites, indicating migratory connectivity in the flyway. Despite this kin structure, we found no evidence of genetic differentiation using genotype data from 1127 individuals across 15 microsatellite loci. We suggest that the existence of migratory connectivity of subpopulations is far more common than previous research indicates and that cultural information may play an important role in structuring reproductive isolation among them.",xavierh22@gmail.com; s.bearhop@ex.ac.uk,2010,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04852.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,AAS,KC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Microsats; not really temporal comparison -- mostly looking at migration distance and a bit about how it changes (or not) over time/between generations,,,,,,,,,

Based on the demographic structure of larvae of N. unicornis colonizing the reef, it cannot be entirely dismissed that siblings colonize together because five spawning dates grouped c. 55% of the captured larvae. Relatedness analysis reinforced these observations and also confirmed that larvae colonizing together were not all siblings. Larvae of the same spawning dates, however, appeared related in some age-classes (72, 74 and 77 days old), suggesting that siblings recruited together. In addition, the larvae appeared genetically different from adults (P=0-002) and juveniles (P<0.001) while juveniles and adults were similar (P=0.100). The variations in allelic and genotypic frequencies in the larvae probably reflect a family-structure that is diluted once larvae are recruited into the lagoon because of high mortality and active movement of fish.

However, determining whether a new invader has impacted native species depends on accurately reconstructing the invasion timing. The arrival of Africanized honey bees (AHB) in southern Utah at some point between 1994 and 2011 has recently been implicated in the local extinction of Perdita meconis, a native specialist pollinator of an endangered poppy, Arctomecon humilis. Although AHBs were purportedly first detected in southern Utah in 2008, their presence in nearby Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico by 1998-2001 suggests that they may have been present in Utah much earlier. We refined the arrival date of AHBs in southern Utah by using a molecular marker to determine maternal ancestry of museum specimens collected between 2000 and 2008. We found that AHBs were present in southern Utah from 2000 onwards, advancing the arrival date of this invader by at least 8 years. This lends credence to the hypothesis that AHB5 played a critical role in the local extinction of P. meconis in Utah. This work also highlights the importance of vouchering even common species such as honey bees in museum collections to serve future research needs.",amberdtripodi@gmail.com,2019,10.2478/JAS-2019-0019,JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL SCIENCE,museum-dna,EG,KC,reject,barcoding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,barcoding,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we document the landscape genetics of northern pike (Esox lucius), based on the analysis of nearly 3000 individuals from 40 sampling sites using 22 microsatellites along the Lake Ontario - St. Lawrence River system (750 km) that locally presents diverse degrees of interannual water level variation. Genetic structure was globally very weak (F-ST = 0.0208) but spatially variable with mean level of differentiation in the upstream section of the studied area being threefold higher (F-ST = 0.0297) than observed in the downstream sector (F-ST = 0.0100). Beside interannual water level fluctuation, 19 additional variables were considered and a multiple regression on distance matrices model (R-2 = 0.6397, P < 0.001) revealed that water masses (b = 0.3617, P < 0.001) and man-made dams (b = 0.4852, P < 0.005) reduced genetic connectivity. Local level of interannual water level stability was positively associated to the extent of genetic differentiation (b = 0.3499, P < 0.05). As water level variation impacts on yearly quality and localization of spawning habitats, our study illustrates how temporal variation in local habitat availability, caused by interannual water level fluctuations, may locally decrease population genetic structure by forcing fish to move over longer distances to find suitable habitat. This study thus represents one of the rare examples of how environmental fluctuations may influence spatial variation in the extent of population genetic structure within a given species.",genevieve.ouellet-cauchon.1@ulaval.ca,2014,10.1002/ece3.1121,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,temporal-genetics,RC,KC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,check for pop analyzes.

This species is a culturally important food fish in the Mariana Archipelago and subject to high fishing pressure. Our primary hypothesis was to test whether the individuals resident in the southern Mariana Island chain were genetically distinct and hence should be managed as discrete stocks. In addition to spatial sampling of adults, newly-settled individuals were sampled on Guam over four recruitment events to assess the temporal stability of the observed spatial patterns, and evidence of self-recruitment. We found significant genetic structure in S. spinus across the western Pacific, with Bayesian analyses revealing three genetically distinct clusters: the southern Mariana Islands, east Micronesia, and the west Pacific; with the southern Mariana Islands being more strongly differentiated from the rest of the region. Analyses of temporal samples from Guam indicated the southern Mariana cluster was stable over time, with no genetic differentiation between adults versus recruits, or between samples collected across four separate recruitment events spanning 11 months.

However, our results from field and laboratory indicate that this is not the case. The subspecies overlap in timing of adult reproductive flight (compilation of field records 1977 to 2018) and laboratory emergence of adults from early-season, non-diapause pupae indicate butterflies are not univoltine. Genetic samples collected from putative E. a. purpura (Early cohort) and cryptica (Late cohort) subpopulations show no evidence of genetic structure indicative of allochronic isolation in phylogenies of 26 mitochondrial DNA COI haplotypes and 18 nuclear ITS1 alleles. Analysis of molecular variance revealed 89% of mitochondrial DNA variation structured within and among subpopulations, with only 11% between the purportedly isolated subspecies. Analysis of isolation and migration indicated gene flow from the Early to Late cohort was 3 x greater than in the opposite direction. We conclude that, rather than two separate subspecies, Euphilotes ancilla exists in a network of partially interconnected subpopulations extending from 1750 to 3000 m across much of the Spring Mountains. Gene flow is related to the timing of adult flight and host plant flowering, contributing to the genetic variation in phenology necessary for evolutionary tracking of shifting flowering periods of larval host plants. Maintenance of connectivity and gene flow across the Spring Mountains is therefore essential for population persistence of both cohorts in the face of environmental change.",daniel.thompson@unlv.edu,2020,10.1007/s10592-020-01254-w,CONSERVATION GENETICS,museum-dna,EG,KC,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,,terrestrial,Insecta,United States,"NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV,NV","2012.05.02,2012.06.13,2015.06.16,2015.08.03,2015.08.04,2015.08.05,2015.08.08,2016.06.03,2017.06.23,2017.07.12,2017.07.17,2017.07.21,2017.08.06,2017.08.09,2017.08.23,2012.06.14,2012.06.18,2012.05.29,2012.06.19,2012.06.21,2012.06.24,2012.07.05,2012.08.05,2012.05.31,2013.06.19,2012.06.06,2013.07.30,2013.08.02,2013.08.05,2013.08.11,2014.08.03,2015.06.06,2015.04.10,2016.04.10","2,5,11,2,2,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,6,1,1,7,15,4,15,5,4,6,3,1,10,1,2,4,4,2,1,4,2,2",365,opportunistic,natural,env_variation,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,NA,NA,DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen),Sanger,PCR,lat/lon available; generation time estimated from: https://fieldguide.mt.gov/speciesDetail.aspx?elcode=IILEPG2110,,,,,,,,,
5603,,Host and parasite life history interplay to yield divergent population genetic structures in two ectoparasites living on the same bat species,"van Schaik, J; Dekeukeleire, D; Kerth, G","Host-parasite interactions are ubiquitous in nature. However, how parasite population genetic structure is shaped by the interaction between host and parasite life history remains understudied. Studies comparing multiple parasites infecting a single host can be used to investigate how different parasite life history traits interplay with host behaviour and life history. In this study, we used 10 newly developed microsatellite loci to investigate the genetic structure of a parasitic bat fly (Basilia nana). Its host, the Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii), has a social system and roosting behaviour that restrict opportunities for parasite transmission. We compared fly genetic structure to that of the host and another parasite, the wing-mite, Spinturnix bechsteini. We found little spatial or temporal genetic structure in B.nana, suggesting a large, stable population with frequent genetic exchange between fly populations from different bat colonies. This contrasts sharply with the genetic structure of the wing-mite, which is highly substructured between the same bat colonies as well as temporally unstable. Our results suggest that although host and parasite life history interact to yield similar transmission patterns in both parasite species, the level of gene flow and eventual spatiotemporal genetic stability is differentially affected. This can be explained by the differences in generation time and winter survival between the flies and wing-mites. Our study thus exemplifies that the population genetic structure of parasites on a single host can vary strongly as a result of how their individual life history characteristics interact with host behaviour and life history traits.",jvschaik@orn.mpg.de,2015,10.1111/mec.13171,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,EG,KC,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,,terrestrial,Insecta,Germany,"Blutsee,Blutsee,Blutsee,Brandtwiese,Brandtwiese,Brandtwiese,Einsiedel,Einsiedel,Guttenberg2,Guttenberg2,Gramschatz1,Gramschatz2,Hochberg,Steinbach,Stalldorf,Stalldorf","2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2011.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2011.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2003.01.01,2011.01.01,2002.01.01,2002.01.01,2002.01.01,2002.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01","12,13,13,17,38,16,24,27,14,42,12,12,36,9,26,21",182.5,pre-designed,natural,disease,,,chronic,microsat,body,ethanol,salting-out,Sanger,PCR,this is a temporal study (looks interesting too) but data is microsats + allozymes,,,,,,,,,

Yet their genetic ancestry and taxonomic status remain controversial. Following ancient DNA procedures, we generated concatenated 1750bp mtDNA sequences from 23 museum samples including 11 voucher specimens from Java and Bali and compared these to diagnostic mtDNA sequences from 122 specimens of living tiger subspecies and the extinct Caspian tiger. The results revealed a close genetic affinity of the 3 groups from the Sunda Islands (Bali, Javan, and Sumatran tigers P. t. sumatrae). Bali and Javan mtDNA haplotypes differ from Sumatran haplotypes by 1-2 nucleotides, and the 3 island populations define a monophyletic assemblage distinctive and equidistant from other mainland subspecies. Despite this close phylogenetic relationship, no mtDNA haplotype was shared between Sumatran and Javan/Bali tigers, indicating little or no matrilineal gene flow among the islands after they were colonized. The close phylogenetic relationship among Sunda tiger subspecies suggests either recent colonization across the islands, or else a once continuous tiger population that had subsequently isolated into different island subspecies. This supports the hypothesis that the Sumatran tiger is the closest living relative to the extinct Javan and Bali tigers.",luo.shujin@pku.edu.cn,2015,10.1093/jhered/esv002,JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,ancient-dna,RC,KC,reject,phylogenetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic analyses reveal erroneous museum data for historic penguin specimens,"Boessenkool, S; Star, B; Scofield, RP; Seddon, PJ; Waters, JM","Historic museum specimens are increasingly used to answer a wide variety of questions in scientific research. Nevertheless, the scientific value of these specimens depends on the authenticity of the data associated with them. Here we use individual-based genetic analyses to demonstrate erroneous locality information for archive specimens from the late nineteenth century. Specifically, using 10 microsatellite markers, we analysed 350 contemporary and 43 historic yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) specimens from New Zealand's South Island and sub-Antarctic regions. Factorial correspondence analysis and an assignment test strongly suggest that eight of the historic specimens purportedly of sub-Antarctic origin were in fact collected from the South Island. Interestingly, all eight specimens were obtained by the same collector, and all are currently held in the same museum collection. Further inspection of the specimen labels and evaluation of sub-Antarctic voyages did not reveal whether the erroneous data are caused by incorrect labelling or whether deliberate falsification was at play. This study highlights a promising extension to the well-known applications of assignment tests in molecular ecology, which can complement methods that are currently being applied for error detection in specimen data. Our results also serve as a warning to all who use archive specimens to invest time in the verification of collection information.",sanneboessenkool@gmail.com,2010,10.1098/rspb.2009.1837,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,historical-dna,ACS,KC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*Microsats,,,,,,,,,

In this study the pattern of gene flow between the two Atlantic stocks of the European hake has been examined for the period 2000-2002. Present analyses indicate that a large genetic homogeneity existed among all Atlantic populations in that period, and that a systematic grouping occurred between Porcupine Bank samples and Cantabric ones. This scenario is congruent with an inter-annual gene flow from central grounds of the northern stock (Porcupine and Great Sole) to Iberian grounds inhabited by the southern stock. Additionally, estimated migration figures were in agreement with the good recruitments observed in the southern stock after 2003 despite the spawning biomass was at its historical minimum. Altogether these results highlight the central role of Porcupine bank and Great Sole in making sustainable both stocks and advocate the integrative management of this hake fishery by means of a multidisciplinary assessment.

Combined with available data, our data set accounts for a total of 41 sequences of cave bear, coming from 18 European caves. We distinguish four haplogroups at the level of the mitochondrial DNA control region. The large population size of cave bear could account for the maintenance of such polymorphism.

Strong conservation measures have allowed the population to recover, but despite the rapid population growth during recent years the species is still classified as endangered. We studied the genetic population structure at both individual and population levels in an attempt to recognize the processes shaping it. We used 9 microsatellite loci and 473 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region on samples collected between the years 2003 and 2007 (N = 489). We found a clear isolation by distance pattern at fine scale (i.e. individual level) which is most likely a result of species' philopatric behaviour. Although we did not find signs of the recent bottlenecks, we did find evidence of an ancient bottleneck that has occurred most likely over 21,000 years ago, long before the genetic divergence of the two present Finnish subpopulations (one along the Baltic Sea coast line and another in Lapland and easternmost Finland). We conclude that the present population structure is mainly a consequence of the species philopatric behaviour over a long time period instead of recent population bottlenecks. Based on our results, the Finnish population seems to have ongoing immigration from neighbouring populations.

8198,,Fine-scale spatiotemporal patterns of genetic variation reflect budding dispersal coupled with strong natal philopatry in a cooperatively breeding mammal,"Nichols, HJ; Jordan, NR; Jamie, GA; Cant, MA; Hoffman, JI","The relatedness structure of animal populations is thought to be a critically important factor underlying the evolution of mating systems and social behaviours. While previous work has shown that population structure is shaped by many biological processes, few studies have investigated how these factors vary over time. Consequently, we explored the fine-scale spatiotemporal genetic structure of an intensively studied population of cooperatively breeding banded mongooses (Mungos mungo) over a 10-year period. Overall population structure was strong (average FST=0.129) but groups with spatially overlapping territories were not more genetically similar to one another than noncontiguous groups. Instead, genetic differentiation was associated with historical group-fission (budding) events, with new groups diverging from their parent groups over time. Within groups, relatedness was high within but not between the sexes, although the latter increased over time since group formation due to group founders being replaced by philopatric young. This trend was not mirrored by a decrease in average offspring heterozygosity over time, suggesting that close inbreeding may often be avoided, even when immigration into established groups is virtually absent and opportunities for extra-group matings are rare. Fine-scale spatiotemporal population structure could have important implications in social species, where relatedness between interacting individuals is a vital component in the evolution of patterns of inbreeding avoidance, reproductive skew and kin-selected helping and harming.",H.J.Nichols@ljmu.ac.uk,2012,10.1111/mec.12015,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,KJ,KC,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,Uganda,"Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda,Uganda","2000.01.01,2001.01.01,2002.01.01,2003.01.01,2004.01.01,2005.01.01,2006.01.01,2007.01.01,2008.01.01,2009.01.01","161,271,220,232,302, 288, 273, 241,285,249","1,570",pre-designed,natural,competition,,,acute,microsat,skin,NA,phenol-chloroform (Sambrook et al. 1989),Sanger,PCR,generation time pulled from: https://www.ewt.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/29.-Banded-Mongoose-Mungos-mungo_LC.pdf,,,,,,,,,
9251,,Genomic analysis of a cardinalfish with larval homing potential reveals genetic admixture in the Okinawa Islands,"Gould, AL; Dunlap, PV","Discrepancies between potential and observed dispersal distances of reef fish indicate the need for a better understanding of the influence of larval behaviour on recruitment and dispersal. Population genetic studies can provide insight on the degree to which populations are connected, and the development of restriction site-associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) methods has made such studies of nonmodel organisms more accessible. We applied double-digest RAD-Seq methods to test for population differentiation in the coral reef-dwelling cardinalfish, Siphamia tubifer, which based on behavioural studies, have the potential to use navigational cues to return to natal reefs. Analysis of 11,836 SNPs from fish collected at coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan, from eleven locations over 3 years reveals little genetic differentiation between groups of S. tubifer at spatial scales from 2 to 140 km and between years at one location: pairwise F-ST values were between 0.0116 and 0.0214. These results suggest that the Kuroshio Current largely influences larval dispersal in the region, and in contrast to expectations based on studies of other cardinalfishes, there is no evidence of population structure for S. tubifer at the spatial scales examined. However, analyses of outlier loci putatively under selection reveal patterns of temporal differentiation that indicate high population turnover and variable larval supply from divergent source populations between years. These findings highlight the need for more studies of fishes across various geographic regions that also examine temporal patterns of genetic differentiation to better understand the potential connections between early life-history traits and connectivity of reef fish populations.",algould@umich.edu,2017,10.1111/mec.14169,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,temporal-genetics,KJ,KC,reject,non-temporal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we sequence restriction site-associated DNA to characterize genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a broadly distributed and highly migratory large pelagic fish, striped marlin (Kajikia audax). Assessment of over 4,000 SNPs resolved spatiotemporal patterns of genetic connectivity throughout the species range in the Pacific and, for the first time, Indian oceans. Individual-based cluster analyses identified six genetically distinct populations corresponding with the western Indian, eastern Indian, western South Pacific, and eastern central Pacific oceans, as well as two populations in the North Pacific Ocean (F-ST = 0.0137-0.0819). F-ST outlier analyses identified a subset of SNPs (n = 59) putatively under the influence of natural selection and capable of resolving populations separated by comparatively high degrees of genetic differentiation. Temporal collections available for some regions demonstrated the stability of allele frequencies over three to five generations of striped marlin. Relative migration rates reflected lower levels of genetic connectivity between Indian Ocean populations (m(R) <= 0.37) compared with most populations in the Pacific Ocean (m(R) >= 0.57) and highlight the importance of the western South Pacific in facilitating gene flow between ocean basins. Collectively, our results provide novel insights into rangewide population structure for striped marlin and highlight substantial inconsistencies between genetically distinct populations and stocks currently recognized for fisheries management. More broadly, we demonstrate that species capable of longdistance dispersal in environments lacking obvious physical barriers to movement can display substantial population subdivision that persists over multiple generations and that may be facilitated by both neutral and adaptive processes.

Significant genetic divergence was detected for both mtDNA and microsatellites (43.sr = 0.070 and FsT = 0.004; p< 0.001), although the differentiation pattern was not consistent through time. Results suggest the presence of population sub-structuring, with at least two genetic units detected: western coast and southern coast of South Africa. The observed low levels of genetic differentiation point to significant gene flow between populations. The absence of temporal stability may result from reproductive sweepstakes, with differential reproductive success between cohorts. These findings suggest that management of South African kingklip should consider two independent stocks, and catches should remain at levels that will ensure the long-term viability of the resource.

1961,,Integrating genetic and otolith microchemistry data to understand population structure in the Patagonian Hoki (Macruronus magellanicus),"McKeown, NJ; Arkhipkin, AI; Shaw, PW","Information from genetic (microsatellites and mtDNA Control Region) and previously collected otolith (trace element fingerprinting of otolith core and edge) markers was jointly interpreted to describe dispersal and gene flow in the Patagonian hoki (Macruronus magellanicus), an intensively harvested marine fish with seasonal migrations between spawning and feeding grounds. Spawning adults from a Chilean (Pacific) spawning site and three feeding ground samples (one from Chile and two temporal samples from the Falkland Islands (Atlantic)) were analysed. The data indicated a high level of Atlantic/Pacific connectivity by means of non-natal homing of individuals to spawning aggregations. Against this background of regional connectivity however, genetic data support the existence of a reproductively isolated population within the overwintering stock. Otolith core results are compatible with reproductive isolation being effected by natal homing to an Atlantic spawning site and/or local adaptation. The discordance between geopolitically defined Atlantic and Pacific management stocks and underlying biocomplexity, and implications for sustainability, are discussed. The study highlights the importance of intraspecific variation in homing behaviours in shaping population structure and the merit of employing complementary analytical approaches.

2231,,Spatio-temporal changes in the genetic structure of the Passerina bunting hybrid zone,"Carling, MD; Zuckerberg, B","Although theoretical models predict that the structure of a hybrid zone can change under a variety of scenarios, only a few empirical studies of hybrid zones have unequivocally demonstrated zone movement. These studies are rare because few data sets exist that include repeated, temporally spaced, samples of the same hybrid zone. We analysed mitochondrial DNA haplotype data from samples separated by 40-45 years from across the Passerina amoena (Lazuli Bunting) and Passerina cyanea (Indigo Bunting) hybrid zone to investigate whether the genetic structure of this zone has changed during that interval. Both cline and generalized linear mixed modelling analyses uncovered a significant narrowing and a substantial westward shift of the Passerina bunting hybrid zone, clearly illustrating hybrid zone movement. The cause of the change may be due to a combination of ecological, demographic and behavioural factors. Our results predict that the width of the hybrid zone will continue to narrow over time, a finding consistent with reinforcement theory.",mcarling@uwyo.edu,2011,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04987.x,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,historical-dna,KJ,KC,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,yes,terrestrial,Aves,United States,"CO,SD,NE,WY,NE,MT,WY,CO,SD,NE,ND","1956.01.01,1956.01.01,1956.01.01,1969.01.01,1969.01.01,2006.01.01,2006.01.01,2006.01.01,2006.01.01,2006.01.01,2006.01.01","16,35,43,6,49,9,27,7,51,52,17",365,opportunistic,natural,competition,,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,Toe pad,NA,Qiagen DNeasy tissue kit,cycle-sequencing,PCR,"generation time found at https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Passerina_cyanea/, time to sexual maturity. lat/lon available in Table 1, metadata for locality key not available.",,,,,,,,,
6821,,Genetic distinctiveness of red foxes in the Intermountain West as revealed through expanded mitochondrial sequencing,"Volkmann, LA; Statham, MJ; Mooers, AO; Sacks, BN","Western North America contains a mosaic of indigenous and introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations. Historically, native red foxes occurred in subalpine zones of the Cascade, Rocky, and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, and in the desert-like Sacramento Valley of California. The origins of red foxes observed in the Intermountain West since the early 1900s are unclear, potentially representing native population relicts from the last ice age, dispersers from adjacent mountain populations, or early fur-farm escapees. These foxes carry a native 696-bp mitochondrial haplotype (A-19), which was also the most basal and widespread among western populations and thus equally consistent with ancient and contemporary origins. Here, to increase resolution, we sequenced an additional 3,308 bp (totaling 4,004 bp) of the mitochondrial genome corresponding to A-19 and related haplotypes (O-24 and D-19) from historical and modern samples collected throughout western North America. The expanded sequences revealed previously undocumented haplotype diversity, including another novel mutation associated with the D-19 matriline endemic to the Sacramento Valley, confirming its ancient divergence. We observed 6 A-19 variants falling into 2 divergent subclades. Although no A-19 variants were unique to the Intermountain West, the 2 dominant ones were rare elsewhere, and an analysis of molecular variance supported the distinctiveness of this population. Our findings suggest this population was either an ancient relict or derived from a small founder group from a neighboring mountain range. Additional sampling and high-density nuclear genomic markers can further clarify origins of these animals, including potential nonnative introgression.",bnsacks@ucdavis.edu,2015,10.1093/jmammal/gyv007,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,ancient-dna,KJ,KC,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,terrestrial,Mammalia,United States,"Northern Rockies,Southern Rockies,Northern Cascades,Southern Cascades,Sierra Nevada,Sacramento Valley","1977.01.01,1915.01.01",NA,365,opportunistic,natural,invasive_species,env_variation,,chronic,mtDNA_seq,tissue.feces.bones,NA,phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,"1977 represents midpoint of 2015-1940, 1915 represents midpoint of 1891-1939; unable to download supplement which contains sample size information; generation time pulled from Kutschera et al.

10394,,Historical and Contemporary Population Genetics of the Invasive Western Corn Rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in Croatia,"Lemic, D; Mikac, KM; Bazok, R","Classical population genetic analyses were used to investigate populations of the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, in Croatia in 1996 and 2009. The number of alleles was low in both 1996 and 2009; however, more alleles were found in the putative populations surveyed in 2009. Croatia had only 51% of the alleles recorded from the United States and 69% from Europe. However, 10 private (unique) alleles were found in Croatia, which were not found previously in Europe. Most populations were out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, although no linkage disequilibrium was found. Low to no genetic differentiation was found between population pairwise comparisons in 1996, with a greater level of differentiation found between populations sampled in 2009. Using the program STRUCTURE, a single genetic cluster was found for populations sampled in 1996 and 2009. However, two genetic clusters were detected when the 1996 and 2009 data were combined, indicating significant temporal differentiation. Isolation by distance pattern of gene flow characterized populations sampled in 2009 only when the most distant population of Ogulin (the head of the expansion front) was included in the analysis. When Ogluin was excluded from the 2009 analysis no isolation by distance pattern was found. The possible impact that control practices have had on the population genetics of D. v. virgifera in Croatia from 1996 to 2009 are discussed in light of the temporal genetics differences found.",dlemic@agr.hr,2013,10.1603/EN12351,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,temporal-genetics,KJ,RC,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,,,,,terrestrial,Insecta,Croatia,"Bosnjaci,Drenovci,Nustar,Otok,Racinovci,Soljani,Mikanovci,Tovarnik,Vrbanja,Vrpolje,Podravska_Moslavina_Ojulin","2009.01.01,1996.01.01","30.25.30.30.12.30.30.30.30.30.12,30.25.30.30.12.20.20.29.30.20.12",365,pre-designed,anthropogenic,invasive_species,,,chronic,microsat,whole,ethanol,Qiagen DNeasy Tissue Kit,Sanger,PCR,"microsats. no rutgers access, also unclear if connectivity? requested article through ILL; RC: generation time pulled from: https://cornrootworm.extension.iastate.edu/basics/life-cycle",,,,,,,,,
6098,,Temporal Population Genetic Structure of Eastern Mosquitofish in a Dynamic Aquatic Landscape,"McElroy, TC; Kandl, KL; Trexler, JC","We analyzed the effect of periodic drying in the Florida Everglades on spatiotemporal population genetic structure of eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Severe periodic drying events force individuals from disparate sources to mix in dry season relatively deep-water refuges. In 1996 (a wet year) and 1999 (a dry year), we sampled mosquitofish at 20 dry-season refuges distributed in 3 water management regions and characterized genetic variation for 10 allozyme and 3 microsatellite loci. In 1996, most of the ecosystem did not dry, whereas in 1999, many of our sampling locations were isolated by expanses of dried marsh surface. In 1996, most spatial genetic variation was attributed to heterogeneity within regions. In 1999, spatial genetic variation within regions was not significant. In both years, a small but significant amount of variation (less than 1% of the total variation) was partitioned among regions. Variance was consistently greater than zero among long-hydroperiod sites within a region, but not among short-hydroperiod sites within a region, where hydroperiod was measured as time since last marsh surface dry-down forcing fishes into local refuges. In 1996, all sites were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In 1999, we observed fewer heterozygotes than expected for most loci and sites suggesting a Wahlund effect arising from fish leaving areas that dried and mixing in deep-water refuges.",tmcelro2@kennesaw.edu,2011,10.1093/jhered/esr088,JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,temporal-genetics,EG,RC,accept,accept,empirical,connectivity,diversity,,,,freshwater,Actinopterygii,USA,"WCA.3A_1,WCA.3A_2,WCA.3A_3,WCA.3A_4,WCA.3A_5,WCA.3A_6,WCA.3A_7,SRS_8,SRS_9,SRS_10,SRS_11,SRS_12,SRS_13,SRS_14,TS_15,TS_16,TS_17,TS_18,TS_19,TS_20","1999.03.01,1996.03.01","32.32.32.30.20.18.31.32.31.33.32.32.32.32.32.32.24.34.32.32,31.25.31.30.29.30.26.22.28.29.28.29.31.22.23.19.21.28.30.29",182,pre-designed,natural,env_variation,,,acute,microsat,muscle,frozen,phenol-chloroform,Sanger,PCR,"sampling lat/lon provided in supplemental material (Dryad dataset), RC: moved to connectivity bc talks mostly about how pop structure changed in dry v. wet years",,,,,,,,,
