All manuscript plots are labeled and found in the `manuscript_figures` sub-directory.

Other plots are as listed:
  * **driver_sd_plot.png:** Stacked, percentile bar plot showing the percentage of each study design category that is made up of studies looking at various drivers.
  * **driver_subject_plot.png:** Stacked, percentile bar plot showing the percentage of each subject category that is made up of studies looking at various drivers.
  * **driver_system_plot.png:** Stacked, percentile bar plot showing the percentage of each system category that is made up of studies looking at various drivers.
